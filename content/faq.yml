    and Exchange Commission of Pakistan). We help you invest your money in Shariah-compliant

  question: Is my money safe with Mahaana?

    than bank savings accounts, while still keeping your money easily accessible.
  category: General
  question: How is this different from keeping money in my bank account?

    PKR 500 anytime. We've kept these amounts low so everyone can start investing.
  category: General

    Add money whenever you want

    No pressure for regular investments

    No penalties for irregular investing'
  category: General
  question: Do I have to invest regularly or can I invest once?
- answer: 'Let me explain the key differences between our two funds! MICF, or our
    Save+ fund, is like an enhanced savings account. It''s a money market fund where
    we invest your money in low-risk Islamic instruments to give you stable returns.
    You can invest directly through our portal, and it''s perfect if you want lower
    risk and easy access to your money.

    MIIETF, on the other hand, is our equity fund that invests in Shariah-compliant
    stocks on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. While it has potential for higher returns,
    it also comes with higher risk. You''ll need a broker account to invest in this
    one, and it''s better suited for long-term investment goals when you can ride
    out market ups and downs.'
  category: Investments
  question: What's the difference between MICF and MIIETF?
- answer: Great question! In MICF, we invest your money in three types of secure,
    Shariah-compliant investments. The main ones are Islamic bank deposits, where
    we can negotiate better rates than individual investors might get. We also invest
    in Islamic money market instruments and Shariah-compliant corporate sukuks. Everything
    is carefully checked by our Shariah advisor to ensure it's 100% halal. Think of
    it as a smarter way to save while keeping your money secure and Shariah-compliant!
  category: Investments
  question: Where exactly does MICF invest my money?
- answer: Instead of trying to time the perfect price, I'd recommend using a strategy
    called Rupee Cost Averaging! This means investing a fixed amount regularly - like
    PKR 10,000 every month - regardless of the price. This way, you'll buy more units
    when prices are low and fewer when they're high, averaging out your purchase price
    over time. It's a smarter way to invest, especially in equity funds like MIIETF,
    because it reduces the stress of trying to guess the "right" time to buy.
  category: Investments
  question: At what price should I buy MIIETF?
- answer: 'Let me share two great ways to grow your money with us! For a lower-risk
    option, our Save+ fund (MICF) is perfect - you earn daily profits, and your money
    stays easily accessible. Think of it as a smarter alternative to a savings account.
    If you''re looking for potentially higher returns and can invest for the longer
    term, our MIIETF lets you participate in the stock market in a Shariah-compliant
    way. You can even use both - maybe keep your emergency funds in Save+ while building
    long-term wealth through MIIETF. The key is choosing what matches your goals and
    comfort with risk.

  category: Investments
  question: How can I make money with Mahaana?
- answer: Let me walk you through it! When you send us PKR 1,000, we don't just keep
    it in a box - we put it in secure Islamic banks and investments that give better
    returns than regular savings accounts. It's like having a friend who can get a
    better deal at the bank than you could get yourself. Your money starts earning
    profit from the very next day, and you can check your growing amount anytime on
    your phone.
  category: General
  question: What exactly happens to my money after I deposit it in Save+?
- answer: Not at all! Your bank account and Mahaana investment are completely separate.
    Even if you close your bank account or it gets blocked, your money in Mahaana
    stays safe. You can just give us your new bank account details whenever you want
    to withdraw.
  category: General
  question: If something goes wrong with my bank account, will I lose my Mahaana investment?
- answer: 'Absolutely not! We do all the math for you. Just log in to your account
    and you''ll see simple numbers:

    How much you invested

    How much it''s worth now

    How much profit you''ve earned No calculator needed!'
  category: General
  question: Do I need to keep track of complicated numbers or do calculations?
- answer: Don't worry! You don't need to understand complex Islamic finance terms.
    We handle all that. Just know that your money is invested in a halal way, and
    you get regular profits without dealing with interest.
  category: General
  question: What if I don't know anything about Islamic finance?
- answer: Not at all! Start with just PKR 1,000 - that's less than many people spend
    on a dinner out! You can add more whenever you want, even PKR 500 at a time. There's
    no pressure to invest large amounts.
  category: General
  question: Do I need a lot of money to start?
- answer: Don't worry! Our system is designed to catch mistakes. Plus, our team checks
    every transaction. If something looks wrong, we'll contact you right away to fix
    it. Your money stays safe even if you make a typing mistake.
  category: General
  question: What if I make a mistake while depositing money?
- answer: 'Start with Save+! It''s like dipping your toes in the investment pool from
    the shallow end:

    Sign up (just need your CNIC)

    Add a small amount like PKR 1,000

    Watch it grow daily

    Learn at your own pace Think of it as a ''beginner-friendly mode'' for investing!'
  category: General
  question: Everyone talks about investing but I feel lost - where do I even begin?
- answer: 'We have two different things:

    Save+ is NOT stocks - it''s more like a better savings account

    MIIETF is for stocks, but that''s a separate product If you''re new, start with
    Save+ - it''s simpler and safer!

    How do I upgrade my account to invest more than PKR 800,000?" A: Let me explain
    the upgrade process! When you click on ''Blue button'' under the upgrade account
    section in your profile, you''ll need to:

    Scan cnic with front camera

    Scan your face with front camera

    Submit proof of income documents

    For salaried persons: Salary slips or bank statements

    For business owners: Bank statements or tax returns

    For other sources: Relevant proof of income

    The upgrade typically takes 5 business days to process. Once approved, your account
    limits will be removed, letting you invest larger amounts. Don''t worry if you
    need help with the documents - our support team is here to guide you through the
    process.'
  category: General
  question: My friend keeps talking about stocks - is that what Mahaana does?
- answer: 'This is actually a regulatory requirement for your protection. The initial
    PKR 800,000 limit is set to ensure safe investing. When you''re ready to invest
    more, we just need some additional verification as required by SECP regulations.
    It''s a one-time process, and after upgrade, you can invest any amount you want.

    “I want to upgrade my account, but each time I try, your system automatically
    activates the front camera for CNIC capture, without any alternative option for
    adjustment. To enhance user experience, this should be replaced with the back
    camera in the settings.” Please understand that capturing your CNIC with a webcam
    is a regulatory requirement that we must adhere to.



    Unfortunately, this process is beyond our control as it is mandated by regulatory
    authorities.



    Hold the NIC in front of your body and allow 30 seconds for the camera to adjust;
    that should do the trick.'
  category: General
  question: Why do I need to upgrade my account?
- answer: To invest in MIIETF, you'll need a broker account with any PSX broker. Once
    you have that, you can buy MIIETF shares through your broker's system just like
    regular stocks. You can find a list of top brokers at www.psx.com.pk/psx/resources-and-tools/investors/top-10-brokers.
  category: Investments

    to track these through your broker's app or platform.
  category: General
  question: Can I see my MIIETF portfolio on Mahaana website like I can see MICF?
- answer: Zakat is only deducted on 1st Ramadan. Don't worry - we'll send you an email
    and app notification a few weeks before Ramadan to sign an online Zakat exemption
    form if needed. Until then, you can freely invest without worrying about Zakat
    deductions.

    to worry about this now - we'll guide you through the process when the time comes.
  category: General

- answer: Check our yearly returns at www.mahaana.com/micf#Performance.
  category: General
  question: What's the annual yield of Save+?
- answer: Save+ (MICF) is definitely the safer option. It's a money market fund that
    invests in stable Islamic instruments, while MIIETF invests in stocks which can
    go up and down with the market. Choose Save+ if you want steady returns with lower
    risk.
  category: General
  question: Which is safer - MICF or MIIETF?
- answer: Being young, you could consider taking more exposure in MIIETF. Since you
    have time on your side, you can ride out market ups and downs, and historically,
    equity investments have given better long-term returns. However, it's smart to
    keep some money in Save+ (MICF) too for stability.
  category: General
  question: I'm young and starting to invest - MICF or MIIETF?
- answer: Save+ (MICF) would be better for regular income needs. It gives steady returns
    and you can withdraw anytime. MIIETF is more suited for long-term wealth building
    where you don't need the money immediately.
  category: General
  question: I need regular income - which fund should I choose?
- answer: Historically, equity funds like MIIETF have given better long-term returns
    than money market funds. If you're investing for the long term and can handle
    market volatility, MIIETF could be a good choice. But remember, higher returns
    come with higher risk.
  category: General
  question: What's better for long-term investment?
- answer: Having a balanced approach often makes sense - some money in Save+ (MICF)
    for stability and regular needs, and some in MIIETF for long-term growth. The
    exact split depends on your age, goals, and risk tolerance.
  category: General
  question: Should I invest in both MICF and MIIETF?
- answer: At this stage, Save+ (MICF) might be more appropriate as it offers stability
    and regular income. You probably want to avoid the market risks that come with
    MIIETF, unless you have other stable income sources.
  category: General
  question: I'm close to retirement - MICF or MIIETF?
- answer: If you might need this money in the next year or two, Save+ (MICF) is your
    safer bet. But if it's long-term savings and you can handle some market ups and
    downs, consider MIIETF. Many investors split their amount - maybe keep PKR 60,000
    in Save+ for safety and put PKR 40,000 in MIIETF for growth potential.
  category: General
  question: I have PKR 100,000 - where should I invest it?
- answer: Both work for monthly investing! Save+ (MICF) if you're building an emergency
    fund or saving for near-term goals. MIIETF if you're young and saving for long-term
    wealth - monthly investing actually helps smooth out market ups and downs.
  category: General
  question: I want to invest monthly - which fund is better?
- answer: Historically, equity funds like MIIETF have given better long-term returns
    than money market funds like Save+. But remember - higher returns mean higher
    risk. MIIETF can go up and down a lot, while Save+ gives steadier, more predictable
    returns.
  category: General
  question: Which fund gives better returns?
- answer: Definitely Save+ (MICF). It's our money market fund that invests in stable
    Islamic instruments like bank deposits. While all investments carry some risk,
    Save+ is designed to be low-risk with steady returns.
  category: General
  question: I want the safest investment option?
- answer: With a 10-year horizon, you could consider MIIETF since you have time to
    ride out market volatility. Maybe start with a larger portion in MIIETF and gradually
    move to Save+ as you get closer to needing the money.
  category: General
  question: I'm saving for my children's education in 10 years - which fund?
- answer: Great approach! You could start with minimum amounts in both - try Save+
    for steady returns and MIIETF to understand stock market investment. This gives
    you practical experience with both types of investing.
  category: General
  question: What if I want to start small and test both funds?
- answer: MIIETF would align better with aggressive growth goals. As an equity fund,
    it has higher growth potential over the long term, though you'll need to be comfortable
    with market volatility.
  category: General
  question: I want to grow my money aggressively - which fund?
- answer: Save+ (MICF) is perfect for emergency funds. You get better returns than
    a regular savings account, while keeping your money easily accessible and stable.
  category: General
  question: Which fund is better for my emergency fund?
- answer: Start with Save+ (MICF). It's simpler to understand, has lower risk, and
    gives steady returns. Once you're comfortable, you can explore MIIETF to learn
    about stock market investing.
  category: General
  question: I'm new to investing - which is easier to understand?
- answer: Yes! While you can't directly switch (since MIIETF requires a broker account),
    you can always adjust your investment strategy by investing more in one fund or
    the other as your needs change.
  category: General
  question: Can I switch between funds later?
- answer: All our fees are transparently shown at www.mahaana.com/micf. The returns
    you see already include these fees since they're built into the daily NAV calculations.
  category: General
  question: What fees do you charge on Save+/MICF?
- answer: No hidden charges! All fees are included in MIIETF's NAV which updates daily.
    Check www.mahaana.com/miietf for complete fee details. The returns you see are
    what you actually get - after all fees.
  category: General
  question: Are there hidden charges in MIIETF?
- answer: Our management fee is calculated and deducted daily in the NAV calculation.
    This means the returns you see on our website are your actual returns - all fees
    are already accounted for.
  category: General
  question: How is the management fee calculated?
- answer: Not at all! When you see your returns or NAV, these are already net of fees.
    We've kept it simple - what you see is what you get.
  category: General
  question: Do I need to calculate fees separately from my returns?
- answer: Total Expense Ratio (TER) is already built into the daily NAV calculations.
    For current TER figures, visit www.mahaana.com/micf for Save+ or www.mahaana.com/miietf
    for MIIETF. You don't need to subtract anything from your returns - they're already
    net of all fees.
  category: General
  question: What's TER and how does it affect my investment?
- answer: No separate deductions! All fees are automatically included in the daily
    NAV calculations. The unit prices and returns you see already account for all
    fees.
  category: General
  question: Are management fees deducted from my account separately?
- answer: Our management fee is calculated and deducted daily when we calculate the
    NAV. You never see separate fee deductions because they're already factored into
    your returns.
  category: General
  question: When do you charge your management fee?
- answer: Think of expense ratio as the total cost of running the fund, shown as a
    percentage
  category: General
  question: What exactly is an expense ratio - explain it simply?
- answer: Both show you how expenses change over time - MTD (Month-to-Date) shows
    current month's costs, while YTD (Year-to-Date) shows the average for the year
    so far. Both are important, but YTD gives you a better long-term picture.
  category: General
  question: I see MTD and YTD expense ratios - which one matters?
- answer: Not at all! The returns shown on our website are what you actually get -
    after all expenses. For example, if you see 10% returns, that's what you're actually
    getting after all costs are paid.
  category: General
  question: Will these expenses eat up all my profits?
- answer: The expense ratio stays the same regardless of how much you invest - it's
    a percentage. Whether you invest PKR 10,000 or PKR 1,000,000, the percentage remains
    the same.
  category: General
  question: Do I pay more expenses if I invest more money?
- answer: Being different types of funds, they have different cost structures. But
    for both funds, you can always find the current expense ratios on their respective
    web pages, and all returns are shown after these expenses.
  category: General
  question: Why are MIIETF's expenses shown differently than Save+?
- answer: Nope! The expense ratio includes all fund costs. We believe in complete
    transparency - what you see is what you get.
  category: General
  question: Are there any hidden costs besides the expense ratio?
- answer: Small changes in expense ratios are normal as fund costs can vary month
    to month. What matters is that all these costs are already included in your returns
    - you don't need to calculate anything.
  category: General
  question: The expense ratio changed from last month - should I be worried?
- answer: Think of annualized like converting a short-term number into a yearly rate.
    It's like saying "if this continued for a full year, here's what it would be."
    For example, if we show 12% annualized, but you're looking at just one month's
    data, we've calculated what it would be over a full year at that rate.
  category: General
  question: What does 'annualized' mean in the percentages I see?
- answer: Yes! Except for MIIETF's performance, all percentages you see are converted
    to yearly rates (annualized) to make them easier to compare. It's like taking
    a monthly return and showing what it would look like over a full year.
  category: General
  question: I see different percentages on the website - are they all yearly rates?
- answer: The actual monthly return would be lower since the 6% is a yearly rate.
    Think of it like this - to get the monthly rate, you'd roughly divide by 12. So
    6% annualized might mean about 0.5% monthly. But remember, returns can vary month
    to month!
  category: General
  question: If you show 6% annualized return, what do I actually get in one month?
- answer: It makes it easier to compare! When everything is converted to yearly rates,
    you can better understand what your money might do in the long run. It's like
    converting different currencies to one currency to compare prices better.
  category: General
  question: Why do you show annualized rates instead of actual monthly returns?
- answer: No - annualized just means we've converted shorter-term rates into yearly
    terms for easier understanding. Real returns can go up and down. It's like saying
    "at this rate" but actual results may vary.
  category: General
  question: Does annualized mean guaranteed for the year?
- answer: No - you'll get the actual monthly return. The annualized rate is just to
    help you understand the yearly perspective. If we show 12% annualized, you might
    get about 1% for one month (though actual returns can vary).
  category: General
  question: I invested for one month - will I get the full annualized return?
- answer: MIIETF's performance shows actual returns since it's affected by stock market
    movements, which can vary a lot. Other percentages are annualized to give you
    a clearer picture of long-term rates.
  category: General
  question: Why is MIIETF performance shown differently?
- answer: Annualized rates give you the big picture - like viewing a map zoomed out.
    While monthly rates are like looking at just your neighborhood. We show annualized
    to help you see the longer-term potential.
  category: General
  question: What's easier to understand - annualized or monthly rates?
- answer: No! Your actual profits are calculated on real returns. Annualized rates
    are just for display and comparison. It's like how weather apps show both current
    temperature and predicted highs - the annualized rate is like the predicted high.

  question: Are my profits calculated on annualized rates?
- answer: Yes! It's an industry standard to show annualized rates. It helps you compare
    different investments fairly, whether you're looking at our funds or others in
    the market.
  category: General
  question: Do other investment companies show annualized rates too?
- answer: Because we recalculate the annualized rate based on the latest performance.
    It's like a weather forecast that updates as conditions change - we're showing
    what a full year might look like based on current conditions.
  category: General
  question: If returns are annualized, why do they change every month?
- answer: Not at all! Annualized rates are like projections, not promises. They help
    you understand the rate of return in yearly terms, but actual returns can vary.
    Think of it like a car's fuel efficiency rating - your actual mileage may vary!
  category: General
  question: Does annualized mean that's what I'll definitely get in a year?
- answer: Deposits and withdrawals typically take 1-2 business days to process. Weekends
    and holidays are excluded, so if you initiate a transaction on Friday, it will
    likely process by Monday or Tuesday.
  category: General
  question: How long does it take to process deposits and withdrawals?
- answer: Yes. Before upgrading your account, you can invest or withdraw up to PKR
    400,000 per day and Pkr 800,000 in total.. After upgrading, there is no daily
    limit. Each limit resets at midnight.
  category: General
  question: Is there a maximum amount I can invest or withdraw per day?
- answer: No, the unit-based system means withdrawals are proportional. This means
    both your initial investment and profits are withdrawn together; separating them
    is not possible.
  category: General
  question: Can I withdraw only my profits?
- answer: You can start with just PKR 1,000. Afterward, you can make additional deposits
    of at least PKR 500 at any time.
  category: General
  question: What's the minimum I can invest?
- answer: 'Currently, automatic monthly investments are not available. Each investment
    must be made manually as direct debit isn''t supported.

    ________________'

    your withdrawal. This rate is the same for both tax filers and non-filers, and
    it's deducted automatically.
  category: General
  question: How is tax calculated on my withdrawals?

    pre-tax on your portal, and any applicable management fees have already been deducted.

- answer: You’ll incur a one-time NADRA verification fee and a daily management fee.
    However, there are no charges for deposits, and no penalties for withdrawals.

- answer: Verification charges are processed quarterly by the CDC and appear in your
    account statement after the end of each quarter.
  category: General

    any upcoming withdrawals.
  category: General
  question: How often is my tax status updated?
- answer: Yes, a mobile app is currently under development. It is expected to be released
    in approximately one month and will be available on both iOS (iPhone) and Android
    platforms.
  category: General
  question: Is there a Mahaana mobile app available?
- answer: Yes, Mahaana’s funds follow strict Shariah guidelines as verified by our
    Shariah Supervisory Council, which includes Mufti Irshad Ahmad Aijaz and Faraz
    Younus Bandukda, CFA, from Al-Hilal Shariah Advisors.
  category: General
  question: Is Mahaana Shariah-compliant?
- answer: All Mahaana funds undergo rigorous screening by Shariah advisors who review
    investment structures, documentation, and processes to ensure they adhere to Islamic
    principles. Only Shariah-approved assets are included.
  category: General
  question: How does Mahaana ensure Shariah compliance?
- answer: For the Shariah compliance fatwa, scroll to the bottom of the MICF or MIIETF
    pages and click on "Shariah Compliance."
  category: General
  question: Where can I find the Shariah compliance fatwa for Mahaana's funds?
- answer: Shariah-compliant investing avoids businesses that engage in interest, alcohol,
    gambling, and other prohibited activities. Investments are only in sectors and
    assets permissible under Islamic law.
  category: General
  question: What does Shariah-compliant investing mean?
- answer: The Shariah Supervisory Council at Al-Hilal Shariah Advisors reviews and
    approves all Mahaana funds for compliance, ensuring they meet Islamic investment
    principles.
  category: General
  question: Who reviews and approves Mahaana's Shariah compliance?
- answer: Mahaana's funds are reviewed quarterly to ensure ongoing compliance with
    Shariah guidelines. This is part of a continuous process to maintain high standards.
  category: General
  question: How often is Shariah compliance reviewed?
- answer: No, there’s no additional cost for Shariah compliance. The process is integrated
    into Mahaana’s investment structure and managed by our team.
  category: General
  question: Is there an added cost for Shariah-compliant investments?
- answer: Yes, detailed certifications, including fatwas and approval letters, are
    accessible at the bottom of the Mahaana MICF and MIIETF pages. Just click on the
    "Shariah Compliance" section for documentation.
  category: General
  question: Can I view the Shariah compliance certification?
- answer: Save+ is the portal used to invest, while MICF (Mahaana Islamic Cash Fund)
    is the actual fund where your money goes. Right now, Save+ is exclusively used
    to invest in MICF.
  category: General
  question: What’s the difference between Save+ and MICF?
- answer: Currently, Save+ only supports MICF, but in the future, Save+ may offer
    additional funds, giving you more choices.
  category: General
  question: Can I invest in multiple funds with Save+?
- answer: Yes, Save+ is simply the platform. Your actual investment is securely held
    within the MICF fund, which follows strict guidelines and is overseen by Mahaana.
  category: General
  question: Is my money safe in both Save+ and MICF?
- answer: 'While they’re effectively the same now, Save+ may support multiple funds
    in the future, allowing you to choose from various investment options.

    What happens to my money if Mahaana closes down?"

    A: If Mahaana were to close, all assets in the fund would be distributed to investors
    based on their share of the fund. This means you’d receive an amount according
    to the fund’s current Net Asset Value (NAV), minus any final expenses.'
  category: General
  question: Will Save+ and MICF always be the same thing?
- answer: Yes, because your money is invested in assets held by a trustee (Central
    Depository Company). Mahaana only manages the fund but doesn’t own the assets,
    so they’d be distributed back to you if the company closed.
  category: Security & Safety
  question: Is my investment safe if the company shuts down?
- answer: In such an event, the assets in the fund are sold, and the proceeds are
    distributed to all investors according to their portion of the fund at the prevailing
    NAV, after covering any final expenses.
  category: General
  question: How would I get my money back if Mahaana were wound up?
- answer: No, Mahaana can’t access or use your invested money. The assets are held
    by an independent trustee, which ensures that your investment is secure and returned
    to you if the company ceases operations.
  category: General
  question: Can Mahaana access my money if it’s closing down?
- answer: Mahaana is licensed and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
    of Pakistan (SECP), ensuring it adheres to financial industry standards. You can
    verify this through SECP's list of licensed entities https://www.secp.gov.pk/document/list-of-licensed-entities-as-of-may-30-2023-nbfcs-2/.
  category: Security & Safety
  question: How can I trust that Mahaana is a legitimate organization?
- answer: Mahaana’s funds are held with the Central Depository Company of Pakistan
    (CDC), which acts as an independent trustee. This structure safeguards your investment
    separately from Mahaana’s operations. The CDC’s details on fund trusteeship can
    be viewedhttps://www.cdcpakistan.com/businesses/trustee-custodial-services/constitutive-documents-of-funds/.
  category: Security & Safety
  question: Who oversees Mahaana’s funds?
- answer: Mahaana Wealth Limited operates under SECP regulations. Both SECP and CDC
    monitor and verify its adherence to financial and operational standards, ensuring
    that all investments are handled responsibly.
  category: General
  question: What proof do I have that Mahaana operates legally?
- answer: You can directly verify Mahaana’s credentials via the SECP's licensed entities
    list and CDC’s trustee documentation for added assurance.
  category: General
  question: How can I verify that Mahaana’s investment funds are genuine?
- answer: 'Before upgrading your account, you have two limits:

    * Daily limit: Maximum PKR 400,000 per day

    * Total limit: Maximum PKR 1,000,000 in total deposits Once you upgrade your account,
    both these limits are removed.'
  category: General
  question: What are the investment limits before account upgrade?
- answer: Yes! Your daily profits automatically become part of your investment value.
    When we calculate tomorrow's profit, it's based on your total value (initial investment
    plus all accumulated profits), so you're earning returns on your returns - that's
    compounding in action!
  category: General
  question: Is my profit automatically reinvested?
- answer: Your profits are already working for you! The profit you see is included
    in your total investment value, and you're earning returns on the whole amount.
    There's no separate "reinvestment" needed - it happens automatically every day.
  category: General
  question: Why do I see profit in my account - isn't it supposed to be reinvested?
- answer: Not at all! The monthly plan you selected is just a suggestion, not a commitment.
    You can invest whenever you want, skip months, or invest different amounts - it's
    totally flexible. Your profits are earned on whatever amount you have invested,
    whether you make regular deposits or not.
  category: General
  question: I selected a monthly investment plan when opening my account - do I have
    to stick to it to get profits?
- answer: Not at all! Your returns are based on what's already invested. The monthly
    investment plan you selected is completely optional - think of it more like a
    goal than a rule. You'll keep earning profits on your existing investment whether
    you add more money or not.
  category: General
  question: Does skipping my monthly investment affect my returns?
- answer: The monthly investment amount is just to help you plan your savings goals.
    It's not a commitment or requirement. You have complete flexibility to invest
    more, less, or skip months entirely - your profits continue regardless of your
    deposit pattern.
  category: General
  question: Why did you ask for a monthly investment amount if it's not required?
- answer: Let me explain with an example. If MIIETF's price was PKR 10 at last financial
    year's close (June 30) and PKR 12 this financial year end, that's a PKR 2 gain
    per share. By law, we must distribute at least 90% of this gain as dividend. So
    if you own MIIETF shares, you'll get your portion of this distribution. The exact
    amount distributed (whether the full PKR 2 or slightly less) is decided by our
    fund manager.
  category: General
  question: How do dividends work in MIIETF?
- answer: While dividends are usually announced annually in early July after our financial
    year ends (June 30), our fund manager has the flexibility to declare dividends
    more frequently - quarterly or half-yearly if they choose to do so.
  category: General
  question: When are MIIETF dividends paid?
- answer: Your dividend is based on the fund's performance over the financial year
    (July to June). We look at the price difference between financial year end dates,
    and by regulation, must distribute at least 90% of this gain. Your individual
    dividend depends on how many MIIETF shares you own.
  category: General
  question: How is my MIIETF dividend calculated?
- answer: Dividends depend on the fund's performance. We're required to distribute
    at least 90% of the gains when we make them, but if there's no price increase
    between financial year ends, there might not be a dividend to distribute.
  category: General
  question: Are MIIETF dividends guaranteed?
- answer: Let me explain how withdrawals work at Mahaana. When you invest with us,
    your money and profits become one combined amount in units. For example, if you
    invested PKR 50,000 and earned PKR 10,000 in profits, your total PKR 60,000 is
    combined in units. When you withdraw PKR 5,000, about PKR 4,167 comes from your
    investment and PKR 833 from profits - you can't separate them because they're
    mixed together in each unit.
  category: General
  question: Can I just withdraw my profits and leave my investment?
- answer: Your profits aren't sitting separately - they're part of your units. Let's
    say you have PKR 50,000 investment and PKR 10,000 profits. This means every PKR
    100 in your account has PKR 83.33 of investment and PKR 16.67 of profit. When
    you withdraw any amount, it will split in exactly this same ratio - it's like
    each rupee contains both investment and profit.
  category: General
  question: I see profits in my account - why can't I withdraw just that?
- answer: Every withdrawal takes a proportional amount from both your investment and
    profits. If you start with PKR 50,000 and earn PKR 10,000 in profits, your total
    PKR 60,000 is about 83% investment and 17% profit. Any withdrawal will maintain
    this same ratio. The good news is you only pay tax on the profit portion of your
    withdrawal.
  category: General
  question: What happens to my investment when I make withdrawals?
- answer: In Save+ (MICF), NAV is the price of one unit. They're connected - NAV tells
    you what each unit is worth. And remember, in Save+, this value only goes up each
    day since it's a very low-risk money market fund.
  category: General
  question: What's the difference between NAV and unit - aren't they the same thing?
- answer: Check your account statement - it shows both your total units and what each
    unit is worth (NAV). For example, if you invested PKR 10,000 when NAV was PKR
    100, you'd have 100 units. Each day, these units will be worth slightly more as
    the NAV increases.
  category: General
  question: How do I know how many units I have?
- answer: Yes! When NAV increases, each unit you own is worth more. In Save+ (MICF),
    NAV only goes up because it's a very low-risk fund. You can track these increases
    daily on our website (www.mahaana.com/micf) or in your account statement.
  category: General
  question: If NAV keeps going up, does that mean I'm making profit?
- answer: You get more units. When you invest more money, we divide your new investment
    by that day's NAV to give you additional units. Your existing units keep their
    same value - they just continue growing as NAV increases daily.
  category: General
  question: When I invest more money, do I get more units or does my unit value increase?
- answer: Mahaana offers Islamic investment options that let you grow your money the
    halal way. You can start with just PKR 1,000 in our Save+ fund, which is perfect
    for beginners. Just visit www.mahaana.com, click 'Get Started', and you can open

    fund. Our Save+ fund gives steady returns that are typically better than regular

    as PKR 500 anytime after that. There's no pressure to invest large amounts or
    make regular deposits.
