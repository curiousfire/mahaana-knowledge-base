question: "I see MTD and YTD expense ratios - which one matters?"
answer: |
  A: Both show you how expenses change over time - MTD (Month-to-Date) shows current month's costs, while YTD (Year-to-Date) shows the average for the year so far. Both are important, but YTD gives you a better long-term picture.
