question: What documents do I need to open an account with mahaana?
answer: >
  To open a basic account with Mahaana, you only need your CNIC and IBAN number
  — it’s quick and fully digital.


  If you’d like to upgrade your account (to invest more than Rs. 800,000), you’ll also need to provide a few additional documents for verification, including your latest 3-month bank statement and proof of income (such as a salary slip, employment letter, or business income evidence).


  These requirements help us comply with SECP regulations while keeping your investments secure.
