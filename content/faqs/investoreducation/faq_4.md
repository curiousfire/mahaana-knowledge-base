answer: 'A: We have two different things: Save+ is NOT stocks - it''s more like a
  better savings account MIIETF is for stocks, but that''s a separate product If you''re
  new, start with Save+ - it''s simpler and safer! How do I upgrade my account to
  invest more than PKR 800,000?'' A: Let me explain the upgrade process! When you
  click on ''Blue button'' under the upgrade account section in your profile, you''ll
  need to: Scan cnic with front camera Scan your face with front camera Submit proof
  of income documents For salaried persons: Salary slips or bank statements For business
  owners: Bank statements or tax returns For other sources: Relevant proof of income
  The upgrade typically takes 5 business days to process. Once approved, your account
  limits will be removed, letting you invest larger amounts. Don''t worry if you need
  help with the documents - our support team is here to guide you through the process.'
