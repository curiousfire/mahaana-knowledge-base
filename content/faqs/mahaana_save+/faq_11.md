question: "I have PKR 100,000 - where should I invest it?"
answer: "If you might need this money in the next year or two, Save+ (MICF) is your safer bet. But if it's long-term savings and you can handle some market ups and downs, consider MIIETF. Many investors split their amount - maybe keep PKR 60,000 in Save+ for safety and put PKR 40,000 in MIIETF for growth potential."
