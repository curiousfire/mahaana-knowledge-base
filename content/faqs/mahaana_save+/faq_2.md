answer: 'A: Great question! In MICF, we invest your money in three types of secure,
  Shariah-compliant investments. The main ones are Islamic bank deposits, where we
  can negotiate better rates than individual investors might get. We also invest in
  Islamic money market instruments and Shariah-compliant corporate sukuks. Everything
  is carefully checked by our Shariah advisor to ensure it''s 100% halal. Think of
  it as a smarter way to save while keeping your money secure and Shariah-compliant!'
