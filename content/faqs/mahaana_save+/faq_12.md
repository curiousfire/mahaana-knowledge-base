question: "I'm saving for my children's education in 10 years - which fund?"
answer: "With a 10-year horizon, you could consider MIIETF since you have time to ride out market volatility. Maybe start with a larger portion in MIIETF and gradually move to Save+ as you get closer to needing the money."
