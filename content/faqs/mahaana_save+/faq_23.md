answer: "A: While they\u2019re effectively the same now, Save+ may support multiple\
  \ funds in the future, allowing you to choose from various investment options. What\
  \ happens to my money if Mahaana closes down?' A: If Mahaana were to close, all\
  \ assets in the fund would be distributed to investors based on their share of the\
  \ fund. This means you\u2019d receive an amount according to the fund\u2019s current\
  \ Net Asset Value (NAV), minus any final expenses."
question: Will Save+ and MICF always be the same thing?
