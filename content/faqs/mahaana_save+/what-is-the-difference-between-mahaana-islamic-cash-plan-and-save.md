question: What is the difference between mahaana islamic cash plan and save+
answer: >
  Save+ and MICF (Mahaana Islamic Cash Fund) are essentially the same thing


  Save+ is the portal or platform that you use to invest, while MICF (Mahaana Islamic Cash Fund) is the actual fund where your money goes. Currently, Save+ exclusively supports investing in MICF.


  In other words, "Save+ is the portal used to invest, while MICF (Mahaana Islamic Cash Fund) is the actual fund where your money goes. Right now, Save+ is exclusively used to invest in MICF."


  Think of Save+ as the interface or gateway you use to access your investment, while MICF is the underlying investment vehicle that actually holds and grows your money according to Islamic principles.
