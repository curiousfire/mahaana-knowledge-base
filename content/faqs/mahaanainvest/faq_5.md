question: "What's the difference between NAV and unit - aren't they the same thing?"
answer: "In Save+ (MICF), NAV is the price of one unit. They're connected - NAV tells you what each unit is worth. And remember, in Save+, this value only goes up each day since it's a very low-risk money market fund."
