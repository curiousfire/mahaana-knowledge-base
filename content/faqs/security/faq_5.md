answer: "A: Yes, because your money is invested in assets held by a trustee (Central\
  \ Depository Company). Mahaana only manages the fund but doesn\u2019t own the assets,\
  \ so they\u2019d be distributed back to you if the company closed."
question: Is my investment safe if the company shuts down?
