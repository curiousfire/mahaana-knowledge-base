question: "Is this like a bank account? Can I take my money out anytime?"
answer: |
  A: While it's not a bank account, it's just as accessible. You can withdraw your money anytime (typically takes 1-2 business days), and there are no penalties or lock-in periods. The main difference is you have the potential to earn better returns than a regular bank account.
