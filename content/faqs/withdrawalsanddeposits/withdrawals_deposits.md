question: "How is this different from keeping money in my bank account?"
answer: "Unlike a bank account which typically gives low returns, we invest your money to earn better profits. Our Save+ fund has historically given better returns than bank savings accounts, while still keeping your money easily accessible."

question: "If something goes wrong with my bank account, will I lose my Mahaana investment?"
answer: "Not at all! Your bank account and Mahaana investment are completely separate. Even if you close your bank account or it gets blocked, your money in Mahaana stays safe. You can just give us your new bank account details whenever you want to withdraw."

question: "Can I deposit from any bank account?"
answer: "You can deposit from any bank account as long as it's in your name."

---
question: "I see profits in my account - why can't I withdraw just that?"
answer: "Your profits aren't sitting separately - they're part of your units. Let's say you have PKR 50,000 investment and PKR 10,000 profits. This means every PKR 100 in your account has PKR 83.33 of investment and PKR 16.67 of profit. When you withdraw any amount, it will split in exactly this same ratio - it's like each rupee contains both investment and profit."

---
question: "Is this like a bank account? Can I take my money out anytime?"
answer: "While it's not a bank account, it's just as accessible. You can withdraw your money anytime (typically takes 1-2 business days), and there are no penalties or lock-in periods. The main difference is you have the potential to earn better returns than a regular bank account."

question: "Which fund is better for my emergency fund?"
answer: "Save+ (MICF) is perfect for emergency funds. You get better returns than a regular savings account, while keeping your money easily accessible and stable."
---

---
question: "Is there a maximum amount I can invest or withdraw per day?"
answer: "Yes. Before upgrading your account, you can invest or withdraw up to PKR 400,000 per day and Pkr 800,000 in total.. After upgrading, there is no daily limit. Each limit resets at midnight."
---

---
question: "Can I just withdraw my profits and leave my investment?"
answer: "Let me explain how withdrawals work at Mahaana. When you invest with us, your money and profits become one combined amount in units. For example, if you invested PKR 50,000 and earned PKR 10,000 in profits, your total PKR 60,000 is combined in units. When you withdraw PKR 5,000, about PKR 4,167 comes from your investment and PKR 833 from profits - you can't separate them because they're mixed together in each unit."
---

---
question: "What happens to my investment when I make withdrawals?"
answer: "Every withdrawal takes a proportional amount from both your investment and profits. If you start with PKR 50,000 and earn PKR 10,000 in profits, your total PKR 60,000 is about 83% investment and 17% profit. Any withdrawal will maintain this same ratio. The good news is you only pay tax on the profit portion of your withdrawal."

question: "What if I make a mistake while depositing money?"
answer: "Don't worry! Our system is designed to catch mistakes. Plus, our team checks every transaction. If something looks wrong, we'll contact you right away to fix it. Your money stays safe even if you make a typing mistake."
---

---
question: "How long does it take to process deposits and withdrawals?"
answer: "Deposits and withdrawals typically take 1-2 business days to process. Weekends and holidays are excluded, so if you initiate a transaction on Friday, it will likely process by Monday or Tuesday."
---

---
question: "Can I withdraw only my profits?"
answer: "No, the unit-based system means withdrawals are proportional. This means both your initial investment and profits are withdrawn together; separating them is not possible."
---

---
question: "How is tax calculated on my withdrawals?"
answer: "A 15% Capital Gains Tax (CGT) applies, but only to the profit portion of your withdrawal. This rate is the same for both tax filers and non-filers, and it's deducted automatically."
