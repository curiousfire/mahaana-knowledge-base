question: Why did I receive less money than I requested for withdrawal?
answer: When you make a withdrawal, a 15% Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is
  automatically deducted, but only from the profit portion of your withdrawal.
  This is a tax requirement, not a hidden fee or bank charge. For example, if
  you withdraw PKR 10,000 and PKR 1,000 of that is profit, then 15% tax (PKR
  150) will be deducted from the profit portion only, meaning you'll receive PKR
  9,850. The tax is remitted directly to the government as required by law.
