question: Are there hidden fees when I withdraw my money? I requested funds but
  received less.
answer: There are no hidden fees on withdrawals. The difference you noticed is
  due to the mandatory 15% Capital Gains Tax (CGT) that applies only to the
  profit portion of your withdrawal. This tax is required by law and is
  automatically calculated and deducted at the time of withdrawal. The rate is
  the same for both tax filers and non-filers. For complete transparency, you
  can view the tax calculation in your account statement, which shows exactly
  how much tax was deducted from your profits.
