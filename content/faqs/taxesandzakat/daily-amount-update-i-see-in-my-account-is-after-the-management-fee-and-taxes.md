question: " Daily amount update I see in my Account is after the management fee
  and taxes?"
answer: >
  Yes, the daily amount you see in your account is already net of management
  fees. The management fee is calculated and deducted daily when we calculate
  the NAV (Net Asset Value). This means the returns and unit prices you see
  already account for all management fees - there are no separate deductions
  from your account.


  However, taxes work differently:


  The daily profits you see in your portal are shown pre-tax.


  Capital Gains Tax (15%) is only deducted when you make a withdrawal, and only on the profit portion of that withdrawal

   Your daily account value already includes all management fee deductions, but taxes (CGT and Zakat) are handled separately when applicable.
