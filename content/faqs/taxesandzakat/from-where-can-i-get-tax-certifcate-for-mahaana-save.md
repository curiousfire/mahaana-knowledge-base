  To get your Mahaana tax report please download the NCConnect mobile app
  (Google Play Store and App Store) by National Clearing Company of Pakistan
  Limited (NCCPL). NCCPL is a financial institution responsible for deducting
  and reporting investment taxes. 


  To get your tax report please follow these steps: 

  Download the app

  Sign up on it and login (you'll be asked for your CNIC number)

  Press on "CGT Details"

  Press on "CGT Certificate & Report"

  Select "Annual Gain / Loss Report"

  Press on "Download Report" button
   
  The report downloaded will have all of your taxes mentioned across investments in PSX, all mutual funds and PMEX. This will simplify the process of filling taxes since all investment taxes are in a single location
