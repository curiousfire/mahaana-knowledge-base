question: " I want to update my profile as a tax filer. How do I do this?"
answer: You don't need to do anything! Our system automatically reconciles tax
  filer status every Monday with the FBR database. If you become a tax filer, it
  will automatically appear on your statement and be reflected in your account.
  The update happens automatically - no action required from your side.
