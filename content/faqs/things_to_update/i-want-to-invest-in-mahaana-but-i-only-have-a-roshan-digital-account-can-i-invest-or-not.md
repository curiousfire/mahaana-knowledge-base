question: I want to invest in MahAana, but I only have a Roshan Digital Account.
  Can I invest or not?
answer: Overseas Pakistanis who wish to add funds to their Mahaana account with
  a Roshan Digital Account (RDA) may do so only from an RDA account by Meezan
  Bank. Alternatively, they may use a local bank account in Pakistan to transfer
  the funds. However, please remember that funds invested through a local
  account cannot be withdrawn to an RDA account later on, while funds invested
  from an RDA account can be withdrawn to a local account at a later stage.
