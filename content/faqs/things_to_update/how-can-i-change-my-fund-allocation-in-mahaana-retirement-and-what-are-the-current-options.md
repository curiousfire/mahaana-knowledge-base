question: " How can I change my fund allocation in Mahaana Retirement, and what
  are the current options?"
answer: "You can choose from five allocation schemes with Mahaana Retirement:
  Conservative, Low Risk, Balanced, Medium Risk, and Aggressive. These schemes
  determine how your money is split between sub-funds like Equity, Debt, and
  Money Market to match your risk preference. Right now, the Conservative scheme
  puts 100% in Money Market, Low Risk has 30% Debt and 70% Money Market,
  Balanced has 30% Debt, 30% Equity, and 40% Money Market, Medium Risk has 20%
  Debt, 50% Equity, and 30% Money Market, and Aggressive has 10% Debt and 90%
  Equity. Currently, we don’t have a method to change your allocation scheme,
  but we’re working on it! This feature will be available in 1-2 months. "
