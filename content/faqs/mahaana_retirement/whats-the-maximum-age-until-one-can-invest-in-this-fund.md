question: What's the maximum age until one can invest in the retirement fund?
answer: The maximum age until which you can invest in the MAHAANA IGI ISLAMIC
  RETIREMENT FUND is 70 years. According to the Voluntary Pension System (VPS)
  Rules, participants can continue making contributions until their chosen
  retirement age, which can be set anywhere between 60 and 70 years. This means
  even if you're above 60, you can still start investing as long as you haven't
  reached 70.
