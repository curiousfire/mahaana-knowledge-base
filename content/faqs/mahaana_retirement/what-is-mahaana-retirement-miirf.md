question: What is Mahaana Retirement / MIIRF?
answer: Mahaana Retirement refers to the Mahaana IGI Islamic Retirement Fund
  (MIIRF), which is a Shariah-compliant voluntary pension scheme designed to
  provide secure retirement savings for participants in Pakistan. It offers tax
  benefits by allowing participants to contribute up to 20% of their monthly
  income to the fund, which results in a proportional reduction in their income
  tax bill. Contributions grow tax-free, and at retirement (age 60), up to 50%
  of the fund balance can be withdrawn tax-free. The fund is ideal for salaried
  long-term investors who are tax filers and want to save on taxes while
  building a Shariah-compliant retirement nest egg.
