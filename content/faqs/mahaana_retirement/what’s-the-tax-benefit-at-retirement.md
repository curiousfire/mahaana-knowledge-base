question: What’s the tax benefit at retirement?
answer: When you retire with the Mahaana IGI Islamic Retirement Fund
  (MIIRF)—either 25 years after your first contribution or at age 60, whichever
  comes first—you can enjoy tax benefits based on your choice. You can withdraw
  50% of your savings tax-free, while the remaining 50% will be taxed according
  to your income tax bracket, with the tax amount withheld and paid to the
  Government. Alternatively, you can transfer all your funds to the Mahaana IGI
  Islamic Retirement Income Payment Plan (MIIR-IPP), which extends your
  retirement plan to age 70. With MIIR-IPP, your money continues to grow in a
  low-risk fund, and you’ll receive tax-free monthly payments until the balance
  reaches zero by age 70.
