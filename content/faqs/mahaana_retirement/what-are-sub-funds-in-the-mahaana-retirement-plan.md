question: What are sub-funds in the Mahaana Retirement plan?
answer: >-
  Sub-funds in the Mahaana IGI Islamic Retirement Fund (MIIRF) are like
  different investment buckets that hold your money based on your risk
  preference. They are part of the overall fund and keep your contributions
  separate for safety and growth. There are three types:






  Equity Sub-Fund: Aims to grow your money by investing mostly (90% or more) in Shariah-compliant stocks listed on the stock exchange. It’s higher risk but offers higher potential returns.




  Debt Sub-Fund: Focuses on safer investments like Shariah-compliant government bonds and bank deposits, with lower risk and steady returns, ideal if you prefer less uncertainty.




  Money Market Sub-Fund: Invests in very safe, short-term options like treasury bills and bank accounts, making it the least risky choice for cautious investors.

  You don’t pick these sub-funds directly. Instead, you choose an Allocation Scheme (like Aggresssive, Medium Risk, Balanced , Low risk or Conservative) that decides how your money is split between these sub-funds based on your risk comfort.
