question: What are sub-funds in the Mahaana Retirement plan?
answer: "Think of the sub-funds in the Mahaana IGI Islamic Retirement Fund as
  different baskets where your money gets invested based on how much risk you're
  comfortable with. Each basket keeps your contributions safe and separate while
  working to grow your savings.You've got three main options:The Growth-Focused
  Basket (Equity Sub-Fund): This one puts most of your money - around 90% or
  more - into halal stocks from companies listed on the stock exchange. It's
  definitely the riskier choice, but that also means it has the best chance of
  giving you bigger returns over time.The Steady Earner (Debt Sub-Fund): This is
  your middle-ground option. It invests in safer things like government bonds
  and bank deposits that follow Islamic principles. You won't see wild swings in
  value, and the returns are more predictable - perfect if you don't like too
  much uncertainty with your retirement money.The Safety Net (Money Market
  Sub-Fund): This is as safe as it gets. Your money goes into super-secure,
  short-term investments like treasury bills and special bank accounts. The
  returns are modest, but you can sleep easy knowing your money is
  protected.Here's the thing though - you don't actually choose these baskets
  yourself. Instead, you pick what they call an \"Allocation Scheme.\" Whether
  you go for Aggressive, Medium Risk, Balanced, Low Risk, or Conservative, that
  choice automatically decides how your money gets divided between these three
  baskets based on your comfort level with risk.‚Äç"
