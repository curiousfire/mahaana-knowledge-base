question: How does contributing to Mahaana Retirement reduce my income tax, and
  whatâ€™s the maximum tax credit I can get?
answer: " With Mahaana Retirement, the percentage of your pre-tax income you
  contribute to the Voluntary Pension Scheme (VPS) reduces your income tax by
  the same percentage, up to a cap of 20% of your annual taxable income. For
  example, if you earn PKR 100,000 monthly (PKR 1,200,000 annually) and pay PKR
  6,000 in annual income tax (0.50% effective tax rate), contributing 10% of
  your pre-tax income (PKR 120,000) to the VPS will reduce your income tax by
  10%, saving you PKR 1,200 annually. If you contribute 20% (PKR 240,000), your
  tax savings increase to PKR 2,400, but the tax credit is capped at 20% of your
  taxable income (PKR 240,000 in this case). To claim this, download the tax
  certificate from the Mahaana portal or app and submit it to your HR or payroll
  team. For more details, watch this video:
