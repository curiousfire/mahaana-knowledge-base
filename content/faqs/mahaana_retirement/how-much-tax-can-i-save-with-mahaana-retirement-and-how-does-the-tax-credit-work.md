question: How much tax can I save with Mahaana Retirement, and how does the tax
  credit work?
answer: >-
  With Mahaana Retirement, you can save up to 20% of your annual taxable income
  on income tax through a tax credit. To calculate your tax savings, determine
  your effective tax rate by dividing your monthly income tax by your monthly
  salary then multiplying by your fund contribution. For example, if you pay PKR
  38,833 in income tax on a PKR 300,000 monthly salary, your effective tax rate
  is approximately 12.94%. 


  Multiply this by your monthly contribution to Mahaana Retirement (e.g., PKR 60,000), and you could save around PKR 7,764 on your income tax the next month. For more details, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW2aw1k996s&t=1s.
