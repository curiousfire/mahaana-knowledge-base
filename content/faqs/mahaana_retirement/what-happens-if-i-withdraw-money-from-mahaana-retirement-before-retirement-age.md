question: What happens if I withdraw money from Mahaana Retirement before retirement age?
answer: The retirement age for Mahaana Retirement is either 25 years from the
  date of your first contribution or when you reach 60 years of age, whichever
  comes first. If you withdraw funds before this age, withholding tax will be
  charged on the entire withdrawal amount (not just the profits) at a rate that
  varies based on your personal tax situation. To calculate the tax, we request
  your tax return statements for the last three years. From the first page of
  each statement, we take the taxable income and tax liability figures, divide
  the tax liability by the taxable income for each year, and then average these
  rates over the three years. This average rate is applied to your entire
  withdrawal amount. If a statement for even one year is missing, we assume a
  35% tax rate for that year in the average calculation. If you are unable to
  provide any statements, a flat 35% tax rate will be applied to the entire
  withdrawal. The exact tax deduction depends on your effective income tax
  bracket, so it's advisable to consult your tax returns or a financial advisor
  for personalized estimates.
