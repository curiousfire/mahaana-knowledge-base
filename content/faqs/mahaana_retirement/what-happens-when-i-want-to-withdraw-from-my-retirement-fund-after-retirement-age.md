question: What happens when I want to withdraw from my retirement fund after
  retirement age?
answer: >-
  You can withdraw from your Mahaana retirement fund when you reach retirement
  age, which is:


  Age 60, OR

  25 years from the date you started investing (whichever comes first)


  How much can I withdraw tax-free?


  50% of your fund can be withdrawn completely tax-free

  The remaining 50% has different options


  What about the remaining 50%?

  You have two choices for the remaining half:

  Option 1: Convert to annuity


  Convert the remaining 50% into an annuity (regular monthly payments)

  You can do this anytime until age 70

  Monthly payments will come from your invested fund

  No withholding tax on these annuity payments


  Option 2: Direct withdrawal of remaining 50%


  Withdraw the remaining 50% directly

  Subject to withholding tax based on your last 3 years' average effective income tax rate

  This tax applies only to the remaining 50%, not the first 50% which stays tax-free
