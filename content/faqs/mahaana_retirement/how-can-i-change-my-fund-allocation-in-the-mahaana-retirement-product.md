question: How can I change my fund allocation in the Mahaana Retirement product?
answer: >-
  Once your first contribution is approved, there is a 60-day cooling-off period
  during which you cannot change your fund allocation. After that, you may
  submit your first allocation change request.


  Subsequent changes: Each time you change your allocation, a new 60-day cooling-off period will apply before you can submit another request.


  How to change allocation: Simply log in to the Mahaana portal or app, go to the Retirement page, and click on the “Change Allocation” button to submit your request.


  Processing time: Allocation change requests can take up to 5 working days to be approved.


  NAV allocation: The Net Asset Value (NAV) applied will be the one available on the date your request is approved, not the date you submitted the request.
