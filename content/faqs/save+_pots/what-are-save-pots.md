question: What are Save+ Pots?
answer: Save+ Pots is a feature inside Mahaana Save+. It lets you split your
  savings into different goals—like one pot for a vacation, another for a new
  phone. Your money still grows because it’s invested in the same Mahaana
  Islamic Cash Fund as Save+. It’s just a way to organize your savings, not a
  new product.
