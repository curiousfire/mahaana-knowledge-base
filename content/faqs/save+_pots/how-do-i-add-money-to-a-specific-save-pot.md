question: How do I add money to a specific Save+ Pot?
answer: It’s easy! Open the app/portal. Tap "Deposit money." Then, tap "Select
  product" to see a dropdown list of all your pots—like "Plan for travel" or
  others. Pick the pot you want to add money to, enter the amount, and follow
  the steps to deposit. Your money will go into that pot, but it’s still
  invested in the same Mahaana Islamic Cash Fund as all your Save+ money.
