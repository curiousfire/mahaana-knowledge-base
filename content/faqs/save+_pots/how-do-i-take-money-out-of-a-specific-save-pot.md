question: How do I take money out of a specific Save+ Pot?
answer: Super simple! In the app/portal tap "Withdraw money." Tap "Select
  product" to see a dropdown with all your pots. Choose the pot you want to take
  money from—like "Plan for travel"—then type the amount you want to withdraw.
  The money will go to your bank account. It’s the same process as withdrawing
  from Save+, since Pots is just a way to organize your savings.
