question: Can I move money between my Save+ Pots?
answer: Not directly, but you can do it in two steps! First, withdraw money from
  one pot by going to "Withdraw money," selecting that pot, and sending the
  money to your bank. Then, deposit that money into another pot by going to
  "Deposit money," selecting the other pot, and adding the amount. Itâ€™s a little
  extra work, but it keeps your savings organized.
