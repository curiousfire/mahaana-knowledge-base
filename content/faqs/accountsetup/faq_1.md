question: "Why do I need to upgrade my account?"
answer: "This is actually a regulatory requirement for your protection. The initial PKR 800,000 limit is set to ensure safe investing. When you're ready to invest more, we just need some additional verification as required by SECP regulations. It's a one-time process, and after upgrade, you can invest any amount you want.“I want to upgrade my account, but each time I try, your system automatically activates the front camera for CNIC capture, without any alternative option for adjustment. To enhance user experience, this should be replaced with the back camera in the settings.” Please understand that capturing your CNIC with a webcam is a regulatory requirement that we must adhere to.Unfortunately, this process is beyond our control as it is mandated by regulatory authorities.Hold the NIC in front of your body and allow 30 seconds for the camera to adjust; that should do the trick."
