answer: 'A: To invest in MIIETF, you''ll need a broker account with any PSX broker.
  Once you have that, you can buy MIIETF shares through your broker''s system just
  like regular stocks. You can find a list of top brokers at www.psx.com.pk/psx/resources-and-tools/investors/top-10-brokers.'
question: "I want to upgrade my account, but each time I try, your system automatically\
  \ activates the front camera for CNIC capture, without any alternative option for\
  \ adjustment. To enhance user experience, this should be replaced with the back\
  \ camera in the settings.\u201D Please understand that capturing your CNIC with\
  \ a webcam is a regulatory requirement that we must adhere to.   Unfortunately,\
  \ this process is beyond our control as it is mandated by regulatory authorities.\
  \   Hold the NIC in front of your body and allow 30 seconds for the camera to adjust;\
  \ that should do the trick.   \"How do I invest in MIIETF?"
