question: "Why do I need to upgrade my account?"
answer: |
  A: This is actually a regulatory requirement for your protection. The initial PKR 800,000 limit is set to ensure safe investing. When you're ready to invest more, we just need some additional verification as required by SECP regulations. It's a one-time process, and after upgrade, you can invest any amount you want.
