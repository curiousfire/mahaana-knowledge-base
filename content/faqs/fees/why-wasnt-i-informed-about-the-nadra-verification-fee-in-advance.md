question: Why wasn't I informed about the NADRA verification fee in advance?
answer: The NADRA verification fee is mentioned in our terms and conditions
  during account opening. Unlike management fees which are deducted daily,
  verification charges are processed quarterly by the CDC and appear in your
  account statement after the end of each quarter. We're improving our
  notification system to better inform you when these charges are applied to
  your account.
