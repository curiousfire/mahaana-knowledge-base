question: Is the NADRA verification fee recurring or a one-time charge?
answer: The PKR 100 NADRA verification fee is a one-time charge only. It will
  never be charged to your account again. This fee is collected by the Central
  Depository Company (CDC) at the end of the quarter in which you opened your
  account. It covers the cost of verifying your identity details with the
  National Database & Registration Authority to ensure compliance with
  regulatory requirements and protect your investment.
