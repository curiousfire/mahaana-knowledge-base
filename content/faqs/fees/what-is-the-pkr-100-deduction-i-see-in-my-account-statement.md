question: What is the PKR 100 deduction I see in my account statement?
answer: This is a one-time NADRA verification fee that is processed quarterly by
  the Central Depository Company (CDC). It covers the cost of verifying your
  identity information when you first created your account. This verification
  ensures the security of your investments and is a regulatory requirement. You
  will only be charged this fee once, and it will not appear again in future
  statements.
