question: "What does 'annualized' mean in the percentages I see?"
answer: "Think of annualized like converting a short-term number into a yearly rate. It's like saying "if this continued for a full year, here's what it would be." For example, if we show 12% annualized, but you're looking at just one month's data, we've calculated what it would be over a full year at that rate."

---
question: "Does annualized mean guaranteed for the year?"
answer: "No - annualized just means we've converted shorter-term rates into yearly terms for easier understanding. Real returns can go up and down. It's like saying "at this rate" but actual results may vary."

---
question: "Does annualized mean that's what I'll definitely get in a year?"
answer: "Not at all! Annualized rates are like projections, not promises. They help you understand the rate of return in yearly terms, but actual returns can vary. Think of it like a car's fuel efficiency rating - your actual mileage may vary!"

---
question: "Are management fees deducted from my account separately?"
answer: "No separate deductions! All fees are automatically included in the daily NAV calculations. The unit prices and returns you see already account for all fees."

---
question: "Do other investment companies show annualized rates too?"
answer: "Yes! It's an industry standard to show annualized rates. It helps you compare different investments fairly, whether you're looking at our funds or others in the market."

question: "I see different percentages on the website - are they all yearly rates?"
answer: "Yes! Except for MIIETF's performance, all percentages you see are converted to yearly rates (annualized) to make them easier to compare. It's like taking a monthly return and showing what it would look like over a full year."

---
question: "What's easier to understand - annualized or monthly rates?"
answer: "Annualized rates give you the big picture - like viewing a map zoomed out. While monthly rates are like looking at just your neighborhood. We show annualized to help you see the longer-term potential."
