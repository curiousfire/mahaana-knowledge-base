question: "Why did you ask for a monthly investment amount if it's not required?"
answer: "The monthly investment amount is just to help you plan your savings goals. It's not a commitment or requirement. You have complete flexibility to invest more, less, or skip months entirely - your profits continue regardless of your deposit pattern."
