question: "If something goes wrong with my bank account, will I lose my Mahaana investment?"
answer: |
  A: Not at all! Your bank account and Mahaana investment are completely separate. Even if you close your bank account or it gets blocked, your money in Mahaana stays safe. You can just give us your new bank account details whenever you want to withdraw.
