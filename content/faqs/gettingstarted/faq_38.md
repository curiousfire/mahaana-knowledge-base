question: "How do I know how many units I have?"
answer: |
  A: Check your account statement - it shows both your total units and what each unit is worth (NAV). For example, if you invested PKR 10,000 when NAV was PKR 100, you'd have 100 units. Each day, these units will be worth slightly more as the NAV increases.
