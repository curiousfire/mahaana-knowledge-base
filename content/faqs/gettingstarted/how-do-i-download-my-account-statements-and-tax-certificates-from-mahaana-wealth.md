question: How do I download my account statements and tax certificates from
  Mahaana Wealth?
answer: >
  You can download your statements and tax certificates through both the web
  portal and mobile app, though the steps are slightly different for each
  platform.

  If you're using the web portal, go to "My Profile" from the left menu. At the top of the page you'll see several tabs. Click on "Statements" and you'll find dropdown menus to select your product type (like Save+ or Voluntary Pension), the document you need, and the time period. Once you've made your selections, click "Download Document" to get your file.

  For the mobile app, tap "Settings" from the bottom menu. You'll see your profile information at the top, and below that are various options. Tap on "Statements" to access the download section where you can choose your product, document type, and time period before downloading.
