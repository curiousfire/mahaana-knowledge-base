question: How can I make money with Mahaana?
answer: >-
  Let me share a few great ways to grow your money with us!


  For lower-risk savings: Our Save+ fund (Mahaana Islamic Cash Fund – MICF) helps you earn daily profits while keeping your money easily accessible. Think of it as a smarter, Shariah-compliant alternative to a savings account — ideal for emergency funds or short-term goals.


  For long-term growth: The Mahaana Islamic Index ETF (MIIETF) lets you invest in Pakistan’s top Shariah-compliant companies through the KMI-30 Index. As these companies grow, so can your investment — it’s a great way to build wealth over time.


  For retirement planning: Our Mahaana Retirement Fund (MIIRF) is designed to help you build your future savings with tax benefits and five different allocation options — from conservative (low risk) to aggressive (higher growth potential). You can choose an allocation that matches your age, goals, and comfort with risk — and adjust it as your needs change.


  Many investors even combine them — keeping short-term savings in Save+, growing long-term wealth through MIIETF, and securing their future with Mahaana Retirement. The key is choosing what fits your goals and your comfort with risk.
