question: created my account and deposited 1,000. The deposit shows as
  "processed" and I can see it in my account. Is my money already invested or do
  I need to do something else to invest it?
answer: >-
  If your deposit shows as "processed," your funds have been invested and are
  earning returns. There is no separate wallet or uninvested balance maintained
  in your account.

  Once a deposit is processed, the amount is automatically invested according to your selection at the time of depositâ€”either in Save+ or Mahaana Retirement. This selection is made during the deposit process and cannot be changed afterward. Your invested funds begin generating returns immediately upon processing.


  No additional action is required on your part once the deposit has been processed.


  Each investment product is associated with a separate and unique IBAN (International Bank Account Number). Deposits made to a specific IBAN will be allocated to the corresponding product only.
