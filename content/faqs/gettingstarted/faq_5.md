question: "What is Mahaana? Is it a bank?"
answer: |
  A: No, we're not a bank - we're an investment company licensed by SECP (Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan). We help you invest your money in Shariah-compliant ways to earn profits. Unlike a bank, we don't just keep your money - we invest it to help it grow.
