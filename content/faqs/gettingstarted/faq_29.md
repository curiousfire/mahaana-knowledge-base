question: What's TER and how does it affect my investment?
answer: >
  The **Total Expense Ratio (TER)** for all Mahaana funds is already factored
  into the daily NAV calculations, so the returns you see are **net of all
  management fees and expenses**. You don’t need to make any deductions
  yourself.


  If you’d like to view the latest TER figures, you can find them directly on our fund pages: [Mahaana Save+](https://www.mahaana.com/micf), [Mahaana Islamic Index ETF (MIIETF)](https://www.mahaana.com/miietf), and [Mahaana Retirement (MIIRF)](https://www.mahaana.com/miirf).
