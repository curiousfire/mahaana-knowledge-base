question: "How do withdrawals work? I'm new to investing."
answer: |
  A: When you make a withdrawal, it comes from both your investment and profits together. Here's how: If you have PKR 60,000 total (PKR 50,000 investment plus PKR 10,000 profit), and withdraw PKR 5,000, we calculate it proportionally. Since profits are 16.67% of your total, PKR 833 (16.67%) of your withdrawal comes from profits, and PKR 4,167 (83.33%) comes from your investment.
