question: How can I be sure that mahaana is a shariah compliant company? Any proof?
answer: >-
  Our funds follow strict Shariah guidelines as verified by their Shariah
  Supervisory Council, which includes Mufti Irshad Ahmad Aijaz and Faraz Younus
  Bandukda, CFA, from Al-Hilal Shariah Advisors.


  To verify Mahaana's Shariah compliance:


  All Mahaana funds undergo rigorous screening by Shariah advisors who review investment structures, documentation, and processes to ensure they adhere to Islamic principles.

  Only Shariah-approved assets are included in their funds. For example, Mahaana Save+ (MICF) only invests in:


  Government Sukuks (Shariah-compliant government bonds)

  Corporate Sukuks (Shariah-compliant bonds offered by companies)

  Islamic bank deposits with trusted banks



  You can find the detailed Shariah compliance fatwa by scrolling to the bottom of the MICF or MIIETF pages on their website and clicking on "Shariah Compliance."


  Mahaana ensures that all their investments avoid businesses that engage in interest, alcohol, gambling, and other activities prohibited under Islamic law. There's no additional cost for this Shariah compliance as it's integrated into their investment structure.
