question: "What happens to my investment when I make withdrawals?"
answer: "Every withdrawal takes a proportional amount from both your investment and profits. If you start with PKR 50,000 and earn PKR 10,000 in profits, your total PKR 60,000 is about 83% investment and 17% profit. Any withdrawal will maintain this same ratio. The good news is you only pay tax on the profit portion of your withdrawal."
