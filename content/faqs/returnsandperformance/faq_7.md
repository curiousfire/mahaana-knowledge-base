question: "What does 'annualized' mean in the percentages I see?"
answer: |
  A: Think of annualized like converting a short-term number into a yearly rate. It's like saying "if this continued for a full year, here's what it would be." For example, if we show 12% annualized, but you're looking at just one month's data, we've calculated what it would be over a full year at that rate.
