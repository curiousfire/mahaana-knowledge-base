answer: 'A: Yes! When NAV increases, each unit you own is worth more. In Save+ (MICF),
  NAV only goes up because it''s a very low-risk fund. You can track these increases
  daily on our website (www.mahaana.com/micf) or in your account statement.'
question: If NAV keeps going up, does that mean I'm making profit?
