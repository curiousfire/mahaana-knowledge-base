question: "What exactly is an expense ratio - explain it simply?"
answer: "Think of expense ratio as the total cost of running the fund, shown as a percentage"
---

---
question: "I see MTD and YTD expense ratios - which one matters?"
answer: "Both show you how expenses change over time - MTD (Month-to-Date) shows current month's costs, while YTD (Year-to-Date) shows the average for the year so far. Both are important, but YTD gives you a better long-term picture."
---

---
question: "Are there any hidden costs besides the expense ratio?"
answer: "Nope! The expense ratio includes all fund costs. We believe in complete transparency - what you see is what you get."
---

---
question: "The expense ratio changed from last month - should I be worried?"
answer: "Small changes in expense ratios are normal as fund costs can vary month to month. What matters is that all these costs are already included in your returns - you don't need to calculate anything."
---

---
question: "Why do I see profit in my account - isn't it supposed to be reinvested?"
answer: "Your profits are already working for you! The profit you see is included in your total investment value, and you're earning returns on the whole amount. There's no separate "reinvestment" needed - it happens automatically every day."
---

---
question: "I selected a monthly investment plan when opening my account - do I have to stick to it to get profits?"
answer: "Not at all! The monthly plan you selected is just a suggestion, not a commitment. You can invest whenever you want, skip months, or invest different amounts - it's totally flexible. Your profits are earned on whatever amount you have invested, whether you make regular deposits or not."
---

---
question: "I saw Mahaana's ad - is this better than my bank savings account?"
answer: "Our Save+ fund typically gives better returns than regular savings accounts, plus it's fully Shariah-compliant. Your money grows every day, and you can still withdraw it whenever you need, usually within 1-2 business days."
---

---
question: "What's better for long-term investment?"
answer: "Historically, equity funds like MIIETF have given better long-term returns than money market funds. If you're investing for the long term and can handle market volatility, MIIETF could be a good choice. But remember, higher returns come with higher risk."
---

---
question: "I want to invest monthly - which fund is better?"
answer: "Both work for monthly investing! Save+ (MICF) if you're building an emergency fund or saving for near-term goals. MIIETF if you're young and saving for long-term wealth - monthly investing actually helps smooth out market ups and downs."
---

---
question: "Which fund gives better returns?"
answer: "Historically, equity funds like MIIETF have given better long-term returns than money market funds like Save+. But remember - higher returns mean higher risk. MIIETF can go up and down a lot, while Save+ gives steadier, more predictable returns."
---

---
question: "Can I switch between funds later?"
answer: "Yes! While you can't directly switch (since MIIETF requires a broker account), you can always adjust your investment strategy by investing more in one fund or the other as your needs change."
---

---
question: "What's TER and how does it affect my investment?"
answer: "Total Expense Ratio (TER) is already built into the daily NAV calculations. For current TER figures, visit www.mahaana.com/micf for Save+ or www.mahaana.com/miietf for MIIETF. You don't need to subtract anything from your returns - they're already net of all fees."
---

---
question: "Do I pay more expenses if I invest more money?"
answer: "The expense ratio stays the same regardless of how much you invest - it's a percentage. Whether you invest PKR 10,000 or PKR 1,000,000, the percentage remains the same."
---

---
question: "I invested for one month - will I get the full annualized return?"
answer: "No - you'll get the actual monthly return. The annualized rate is just to help you understand the yearly perspective. If we show 12% annualized, you might get about 1% for one month (though actual returns can vary)."
---

---
question: "Is my profit automatically reinvested?"
answer: "Yes! Your daily profits automatically become part of your investment value. When we calculate tomorrow's profit, it's based on your total value (initial investment plus all accumulated profits), so you're earning returns on your returns - that's compounding in action!"
---

---
question: "Does skipping my monthly investment affect my returns?"
answer: "Not at all! Your returns are based on what's already invested. The monthly investment plan you selected is completely optional - think of it more like a goal than a rule. You'll keep earning profits on your existing investment whether you add more money or not."
---

---
question: "What if I don't understand investment terms?"
answer: "Don't worry! We've made everything simple to understand. Our portal shows your investment value clearly, and our support team is always ready to explain anything you're unsure about. You don't need any investment experience to start."
---

---
question: "Do I need to calculate fees separately from my returns?"
answer: "Not at all! When you see your returns or NAV, these are already net of fees. We've kept it simple - what you see is what you get."
---

---
question: "Will these expenses eat up all my profits?"
answer: "Not at all! The returns shown on our website are what you actually get - after all expenses. For example, if you see 10% returns, that's what you're actually getting after all costs are paid."
---

---
question: "If you show 6% annualized return, what do I actually get in one month?"
answer: "The actual monthly return would be lower since the 6% is a yearly rate. Think of it like this - to get the monthly rate, you'd roughly divide by 12. So 6% annualized might mean about 0.5% monthly. But remember, returns can vary month to month!"
---

---
question: "Why do you show annualized rates instead of actual monthly returns?"
answer: "It makes it easier to compare! When everything is converted to yearly rates, you can better understand what your money might do in the long run. It's like converting different currencies to one currency to compare prices better."
---

---
question: "Are my profits calculated on annualized rates?"
answer: "No! Your actual profits are calculated on real returns. Annualized rates are just for display and comparison. It's like how weather apps show both current temperature and predicted highs - the annualized rate is like the predicted high."
---

---
question: "If returns are annualized, why do they change every month?"
answer: "Because we recalculate the annualized rate based on the latest performance. It's like a weather forecast that updates as conditions change - we're showing what a full year might look like based on current conditions."
---

---
question: "How are profits calculated?"
answer: "Profits are accrued daily and added to your total investment. Theyâ€™re shown pre-tax on your portal, and any applicable management fees have already been deducted."
---

---
question: "If NAV keeps going up, does that mean I'm making profit?"
answer: "Yes! When NAV increases, each unit you own is worth more. In Save+ (MICF), NAV only goes up because it's a very low-risk fund. You can track these increases daily on our website (www.mahaana.com/micf) or in your account statement."
---

---
question: "How much profit will I make?"
answer: "While we can't guarantee future returns, you can check our latest performance at www.mahaana.com/micf for Save+ or www.mahaana.com/miietf for our stock market fund. Our Save+ fund gives steady returns that are typically better than regular savings accounts."
