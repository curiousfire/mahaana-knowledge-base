question: "Does annualized mean that's what I'll definitely get in a year?"
answer: |
  A: Not at all! Annualized rates are like projections, not promises. They help you understand the rate of return in yearly terms, but actual returns can vary. Think of it like a car's fuel efficiency rating - your actual mileage may vary!
