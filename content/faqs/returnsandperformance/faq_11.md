question: "Why is everything converted to yearly rates? It's confusing!"
answer: |
  A: It actually makes things simpler! It's like when you're comparing car speeds - you use kilometers per hour even for short distances. Showing everything as yearly rates lets you easily compare different investments, even if you're looking at different time periods.
