answer: 'A: Your profits aren''t sitting separately - they''re part of your units.
  Let''s say you have PKR 50,000 investment and PKR 10,000 profits. This means every
  PKR 100 in your account has PKR 83.33 of investment and PKR 16.67 of profit. When
  you withdraw any amount, it will split in exactly this same ratio - it''s like each
  rupee contains both investment and profit.'
question: I see profits in my account - why can't I withdraw just that?
