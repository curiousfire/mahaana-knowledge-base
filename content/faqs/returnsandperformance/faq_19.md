question: "Can I just withdraw my profits and leave my investment?"
answer: |
  A: Let me explain how withdrawals work at Mahaana. When you invest with us, your money and profits become one combined amount in units. For example, if you invested PKR 50,000 and earned PKR 10,000 in profits, your total PKR 60,000 is combined in units. When you withdraw PKR 5,000, about PKR 4,167 comes from your investment and PKR 833 from profits - you can't separate them because they're mixed together in each unit.
