question: "Which fund gives better returns?"
answer: |
  A: Historically, equity funds like MIIETF have given better long-term returns than money market funds like Save+. But remember - higher returns mean higher risk. MIIETF can go up and down a lot, while Save+ gives steadier, more predictable returns.
