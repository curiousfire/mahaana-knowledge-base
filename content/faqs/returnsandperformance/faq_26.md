question: "If you show 6% annualized return, what do I actually get in one month?"
answer: "The actual monthly return would be lower since the 6% is a yearly rate. Think of it like this - to get the monthly rate, you'd roughly divide by 12. So 6% annualized might mean about 0.5% monthly. But remember, returns can vary month to month!"
