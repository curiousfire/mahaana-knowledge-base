answer: 'A: Not at all! Your returns are based on what''s already invested. The monthly
  investment plan you selected is completely optional - think of it more like a goal
  than a rule. You''ll keep earning profits on your existing investment whether you
  add more money or not.'
question: Does skipping my monthly investment affect my returns?
