answer: 'A: Yes! Your daily profits automatically become part of your investment value.
  When we calculate tomorrow''s profit, it''s based on your total value (initial investment
  plus all accumulated profits), so you''re earning returns on your returns - that''s
  compounding in action!'
question: Is my profit automatically reinvested?
