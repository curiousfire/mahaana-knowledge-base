question: "What's TER and how does it affect my investment?"
answer: "Total Expense Ratio (TER) is already built into the daily NAV calculations. For current TER figures, visit www.mahaana.com/micf for Save+ or www.mahaana.com/miietf for MIIETF. You don't need to subtract anything from your returns - they're already net of all fees."
