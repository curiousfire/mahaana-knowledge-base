question: "I selected a monthly investment plan when opening my account - do I have to stick to it to get profits?"
answer: |
  A: Not at all! The monthly plan you selected is just a suggestion, not a commitment. You can invest whenever you want, skip months, or invest different amounts - it's totally flexible. Your profits are earned on whatever amount you have invested, whether you make regular deposits or not.
