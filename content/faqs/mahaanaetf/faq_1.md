answer: 'A: Instead of trying to time the perfect price, I''d recommend using a strategy
  called Rupee Cost Averaging! This means investing a fixed amount regularly - like
  PKR 10,000 every month - regardless of the price. This way, you''ll buy more units
  when prices are low and fewer when they''re high, averaging out your purchase price
  over time. It''s a smarter way to invest, especially in equity funds like MIIETF,
  because it reduces the stress of trying to guess the ''right'' time to buy.'
question: At what price should I buy MIIETF?
