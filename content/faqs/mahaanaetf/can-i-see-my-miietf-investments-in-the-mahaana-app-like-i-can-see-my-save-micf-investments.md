question: Can I see my MIIETF investments in the Mahaana app like I can see my
  Save+/MICF investments?
answer: >-
  MIIETF investments purchased through a broker cannot be viewed on the Mahaana
  app or portal. Since MIIETF shares are bought through your broker account (not
  directly through Mahaana), you'll need to track these holdings through your
  broker's platform or app.


  Good news: Mahaana is launching a new product called "Mahaana Invest" between June-August 2026 that will allow you to invest in ETFs directly through our portal and track those investments within the Mahaana ecosystem. This feature will only display ETF purchases made through the Mahaana platform.
