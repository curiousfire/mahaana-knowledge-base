question: " Does the fund purify any non-Shariah compliant income?"
answer: Yes, the MIIETF purifies any non-Shariah compliant income. The Shariah
  Advisor determines the appropriate percentage of income and cash flows that
  may have come from activities not in accordance with Shariah principles. This
  amount is then donated to charities selected by the Management Company,
  ensuring that the fund remains fully Shariah compliant. The donated amount
  cannot be used for the benefit of the Shariah Advisor, Management Company, or
  any of their employees.
