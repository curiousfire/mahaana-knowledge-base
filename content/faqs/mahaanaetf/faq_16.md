question: "How do dividends work in MIIETF?"
answer: "Let me explain with an example. If MIIETF's price was PKR 10 at last financial year's close (June 30) and PKR 12 this financial year end, that's a PKR 2 gain per share. By law, we must distribute at least 90% of this gain as dividend. So if you own MIIETF shares, you'll get your portion of this distribution. The exact amount distributed (whether the full PKR 2 or slightly less) is decided by our fund manager."
