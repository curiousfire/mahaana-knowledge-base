question: "At what price should I buy MIIETF?"
answer: "Instead of trying to time the perfect price, I'd recommend using a strategy called Rupee Cost Averaging! This means investing a fixed amount regularly - like PKR 10,000 every month - regardless of the price. This way, you'll buy more units when prices are low and fewer when they're high, averaging out your purchase price over time. It's a smarter way to invest, especially in equity funds like MIIETF, because it reduces the stress of trying to guess the "right" time to buy."

question: "How do dividends work in MIIETF?"
answer: "Let me explain with an example. If MIIETF's price was PKR 10 at last financial year's close (June 30) and PKR 12 this financial year end, that's a PKR 2 gain per share. By law, we must distribute at least 90% of this gain as dividend. So if you own MIIETF shares, you'll get your portion of this distribution. The exact amount distributed (whether the full PKR 2 or slightly less) is decided by our fund manager."

question: "How is my MIIETF dividend calculated?"
answer: "Your dividend is based on the fund's performance over the financial year (July to June). We look at the price difference between financial year end dates, and by regulation, must distribute at least 90% of this gain. Your individual dividend depends on how many MIIETF shares you own."

---
question: "Are MIIETF dividends guaranteed?"
