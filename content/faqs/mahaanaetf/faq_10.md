question: "I'm young and starting to invest - MICF or MIIETF?"
answer: "Being young, you could consider taking more exposure in MIIETF. Since you have time on your side, you can ride out market ups and downs, and historically, equity investments have given better long-term returns. However, it's smart to keep some money in Save+ (MICF) too for stability."
