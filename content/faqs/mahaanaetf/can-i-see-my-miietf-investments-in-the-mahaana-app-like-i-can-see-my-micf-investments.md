question: Can I see my MIIETF investments in the Mahaana app like I can see my
  MICF investments?
answer: No, MIIETF investments can't be viewed on Mahaana's website or mobile
  app. Since MIIETF is purchased through your broker account rather than
  directly through Mahaana, you'll need to track these investments through your
  broker's platform. This is different from MICF/Save+ investments which are
  made directly through the Mahaana portal and can be monitored there.
