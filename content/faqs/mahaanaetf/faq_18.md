question: "How is my MIIETF dividend calculated?"
answer: "Your dividend is based on the fund's performance over the financial year (July to June). We look at the price difference between financial year end dates, and by regulation, must distribute at least 90% of this gain. Your individual dividend depends on how many MIIETF shares you own."
