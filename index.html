    <h1>Mahaana Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>General</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What's the minimum amount I need to start?</div>
  <div class="answer">You can start with just PKR 1,000! After that, you can add as little as PKR 500 anytime. We've kept these amounts low so everyone can start investing.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Who regulates Mahaana?</div>
  <div class="answer">We're regulated by SECP (Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan), the official regulator for investment companies in Pakistan. We also have CDC (Central Depository Company) as our trustee, adding another layer of security for your investment.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How long has Mahaana been operating?</div>
  <div class="answer">We started in March 2023 after getting all regulatory approvals. While we're new, we have an experienced team and have already shown strong performance, with our Save+ fund consistently giving competitive returns.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Can someone steal my money?</div>
  <div class="answer">We take security very seriously:<br>All withdrawals only go to your registered bank account<br>Every transaction needs OTP verification<br>Multiple security layers protect your account<br>Regular security audits</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How can I make money with Mahaana?</div>
  <div class="answer">Let me share two great ways to grow your money with us! For a lower-risk option, our Save+ fund (MICF) is perfect - you earn daily profits, and your money stays easily accessible. Think of it as a smarter alternative to a savings account. If you're looking for potentially higher returns and can invest for the longer term, our MIIETF lets you participate in the stock market in a Shariah-compliant way. You can even use both - maybe keep your emergency funds in Save+ while building long-term wealth through MIIETF. The key is choosing what matches your goals and comfort with risk.<br>Would you like me to add:<br>More strategy questions?<br>Questions about combining both funds?<br>Specific scenarios for different types of investors?<br>Questions about investment timing?</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Do I need to keep track of complicated numbers or do calculations?</div>
  <div class="answer">Absolutely not! We do all the math for you. Just log in to your account and you'll see simple numbers:<br>How much you invested<br>How much it's worth now<br>How much profit you've earned No calculator needed!</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Do I need a lot of money to start?</div>
  <div class="answer">Not at all! Start with just PKR 1,000 - that's less than many people spend on a dinner out! You can add more whenever you want, even PKR 500 at a time. There's no pressure to invest large amounts.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">My friend keeps talking about stocks - is that what Mahaana does?</div>
  <div class="answer">We have two different things:<br>Save+ is NOT stocks - it's more like a better savings account<br>MIIETF is for stocks, but that's a separate product If you're new, start with Save+ - it's simpler and safer!<br>How do I upgrade my account to invest more than PKR 800,000?" A: Let me explain the upgrade process! When you click on 'Blue button' under the upgrade account section in your profile, you'll need to:<br>Scan cnic with front camera<br>Scan your face with front camera<br>Submit proof of income documents<br>For salaried persons: Salary slips or bank statements<br>For business owners: Bank statements or tax returns<br>For other sources: Relevant proof of income<br>The upgrade typically takes 5 business days to process. Once approved, your account limits will be removed, letting you invest larger amounts. Don't worry if you need help with the documents - our support team is here to guide you through the process.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Where can I see my detailed unit information?</div>
  <div class="answer">Log into portal.mahaana.com, go to "My Profile", and click on "Account Statement" in the navigation bar. Download the statement to view detailed transaction and unit information.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How is the management fee calculated?</div>
  <div class="answer">Our management fee is calculated and deducted daily in the NAV calculation. This means the returns you see on our website are your actual returns - all fees are already accounted for.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">When do you charge your management fee?</div>
  <div class="answer">Our management fee is calculated and deducted daily when we calculate the NAV. You never see separate fee deductions because they're already factored into your returns.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What exactly is an expense ratio - explain it simply?</div>
  <div class="answer">Think of expense ratio as the total cost of running the fund, shown as a percentage</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I see MTD and YTD expense ratios - which one matters?</div>
  <div class="answer">Both show you how expenses change over time - MTD (Month-to-Date) shows current month's costs, while YTD (Year-to-Date) shows the average for the year so far. Both are important, but YTD gives you a better long-term picture.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Are there any hidden costs besides the expense ratio?</div>
  <div class="answer">Nope! The expense ratio includes all fund costs. We believe in complete transparency - what you see is what you get.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">The expense ratio changed from last month - should I be worried?</div>
  <div class="answer">Small changes in expense ratios are normal as fund costs can vary month to month. What matters is that all these costs are already included in your returns - you don't need to calculate anything.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What does 'annualized' mean in the percentages I see?</div>
  <div class="answer">Think of annualized like converting a short-term number into a yearly rate. It's like saying "if this continued for a full year, here's what it would be." For example, if we show 12% annualized, but you're looking at just one month's data, we've calculated what it would be over a full year at that rate.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Does annualized mean guaranteed for the year?</div>
  <div class="answer">No - annualized just means we've converted shorter-term rates into yearly terms for easier understanding. Real returns can go up and down. It's like saying "at this rate" but actual results may vary.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Does annualized mean that's what I'll definitely get in a year?</div>
  <div class="answer">Not at all! Annualized rates are like projections, not promises. They help you understand the rate of return in yearly terms, but actual returns can vary. Think of it like a car's fuel efficiency rating - your actual mileage may vary!</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Can I use digital wallets like NayaPay or SadaPay for transactions?</div>
  <div class="answer">Due to CDC regulations, only traditional bank accounts are accepted. Digital wallets, such as NayaPay or SadaPay, cannot be added during account registration.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What fees should I expect?</div>
  <div class="answer">You’ll incur a one-time NADRA verification fee and a daily management fee. However, there are no charges for deposits, and no penalties for withdrawals.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How would I get my money back if Mahaana were wound up?</div>
  <div class="answer">In such an event, the assets in the fund are sold, and the proceeds are distributed to all investors according to their portion of the fund at the prevailing NAV, after covering any final expenses.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Can Mahaana access my money if it’s closing down?</div>
  <div class="answer">No, Mahaana can’t access or use your invested money. The assets are held by an independent trustee, which ensures that your investment is secure and returned to you if the company ceases operations.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How do I know how many units I have?</div>
  <div class="answer">Check your account statement - it shows both your total units and what each unit is worth (NAV). For example, if you invested PKR 10,000 when NAV was PKR 100, you'd have 100 units. Each day, these units will be worth slightly more as the NAV increases.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How can I make money with Mahaana?</div>
  <div class="answer">We offer two ways to grow your money:<br>1. Save+ (MICF): A low-risk option where your money grows steadily every day, perfect if you want stable returns and easy access to your money.<br>2. MIIETF: For stock market investment through your broker, better for long-term growth if you can handle some market ups and downs.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Do I need lots of money to start?</div>
  <div class="answer">Not at all! Start with just PKR 1,000 in Save+, and you can add as little as PKR 500 anytime after that. There's no pressure to invest large amounts or make regular deposits.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How quickly can I get started? Is there lots of paperwork?</div>
  <div class="answer">You can start today! Everything is online - no paperwork needed. Just your CNIC, bank account details, and a few minutes of your time. Once your account is approved (usually same day), you can make your first investment right away.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What if I need my money urgently?</div>
  <div class="answer">You can request a withdrawal anytime through your online account. It typically takes 1-2 business days to reach your bank account. There are no penalties or lock-in periods.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I saw Mahaana's ad - how do I join?</div>
  <div class="answer">Ready to start? Go to https://portal.mahaana.com/auth/signup and create your account. It takes just a few minutes to begin your investment journey.</div>
</div>
<h2>Account & Verification</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How is this different from keeping money in my bank account?</div>
  <div class="answer">Unlike a bank account which typically gives low returns, we invest your money to earn better profits. Our Save+ fund has historically given better returns than bank savings accounts, while still keeping your money easily accessible.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">If something goes wrong with my bank account, will I lose my Mahaana investment?</div>
  <div class="answer">Not at all! Your bank account and Mahaana investment are completely separate. Even if you close your bank account or it gets blocked, your money in Mahaana stays safe. You can just give us your new bank account details whenever you want to withdraw.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Why do I need to upgrade my account?</div>
  <div class="answer">This is actually a regulatory requirement for your protection. The initial PKR 800,000 limit is set to ensure safe investing. When you're ready to invest more, we just need some additional verification as required by SECP regulations. It's a one-time process, and after upgrade, you can invest any amount you want.<br>“I want to upgrade my account, but each time I try, your system automatically activates the front camera for CNIC capture, without any alternative option for adjustment. To enhance user experience, this should be replaced with the back camera in the settings.” Please understand that capturing your CNIC with a webcam is a regulatory requirement that we must adhere to.<br><br><br>Unfortunately, this process is beyond our control as it is mandated by regulatory authorities.<br><br><br>Hold the NIC in front of your body and allow 30 seconds for the camera to adjust; that should do the trick.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Can I deposit from any bank account?</div>
  <div class="answer">You can deposit from any bank account as long as it's in your name.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Are management fees deducted from my account separately?</div>
  <div class="answer">No separate deductions! All fees are automatically included in the daily NAV calculations. The unit prices and returns you see already account for all fees.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">When will I see verification charges on my account?</div>
  <div class="answer">Verification charges are processed quarterly by the CDC and appear in your account statement after the end of each quarter.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What are the investment limits before account upgrade?</div>
  <div class="answer">Before upgrading your account, you have two limits:<br>* Daily limit: Maximum PKR 400,000 per day<br>* Total limit: Maximum PKR 1,000,000 in total deposits Once you upgrade your account, both these limits are removed.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Why do I see profit in my account - isn't it supposed to be reinvested?</div>
  <div class="answer">Your profits are already working for you! The profit you see is included in your total investment value, and you're earning returns on the whole amount. There's no separate "reinvestment" needed - it happens automatically every day.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I selected a monthly investment plan when opening my account - do I have to stick to it to get profits?</div>
  <div class="answer">Not at all! The monthly plan you selected is just a suggestion, not a commitment. You can invest whenever you want, skip months, or invest different amounts - it's totally flexible. Your profits are earned on whatever amount you have invested, whether you make regular deposits or not.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I see profits in my account - why can't I withdraw just that?</div>
  <div class="answer">Your profits aren't sitting separately - they're part of your units. Let's say you have PKR 50,000 investment and PKR 10,000 profits. This means every PKR 100 in your account has PKR 83.33 of investment and PKR 16.67 of profit. When you withdraw any amount, it will split in exactly this same ratio - it's like each rupee contains both investment and profit.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Is this like a bank account? Can I take my money out anytime?</div>
  <div class="answer">While it's not a bank account, it's just as accessible. You can withdraw your money anytime (typically takes 1-2 business days), and there are no penalties or lock-in periods. The main difference is you have the potential to earn better returns than a regular bank account.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I saw Mahaana's ad - is this better than my bank savings account?</div>
  <div class="answer">Our Save+ fund typically gives better returns than regular savings accounts, plus it's fully Shariah-compliant. Your money grows every day, and you can still withdraw it whenever you need, usually within 1-2 business days.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How to open a Mahaana account?</div>
  <div class="answer">Visit our signup page at https://portal.mahaana.com/auth/signup - it's quick and easy. You can start investing right after your account is approved.</div>
</div>
<h2>Investments & Funds</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Can I lose money investing with Mahaana?</div>
  <div class="answer">While all investments carry some risk, our Save+ fund is designed to be low-risk. We invest in stable, Shariah-compliant instruments like Islamic bank deposits to protect your money while earning good returns.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I'm completely new to investing - where should I start?</div>
  <div class="answer">Start with our Save+ fund! It's perfect for beginners because:<br>Low risk<br>Start with just PKR 1,000<br>Withdraw anytime<br>Easy to understand<br>Daily profits</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">

</div>
<div class="faq-item">

  <div class="answer">You can see everything in your online account:<br>Daily profit updates<br>All transactions<br>Current investment value<br>Bank-verified statements</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What if I make a mistake while investing?</div>
  <div class="answer">Don't worry! Our system has safety checks to prevent mistakes. If you accidentally enter wrong information, our team will help fix it. Plus, all important actions need OTP verification for security.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Do I have to invest regularly or can I invest once?</div>
  <div class="answer">It's completely up to you! You can:<br>Invest once and leave it to grow<br>Add money whenever you want<br>No pressure for regular investments<br>No penalties for irregular investing</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What's the difference between MICF and MIIETF?</div>
  <div class="answer">Let me explain the key differences between our two funds! MICF, or our Save+ fund, is like an enhanced savings account. It's a money market fund where we invest your money in low-risk Islamic instruments to give you stable returns. You can invest directly through our portal, and it's perfect if you want lower risk and easy access to your money.<br>MIIETF, on the other hand, is our equity fund that invests in Shariah-compliant stocks on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. While it has potential for higher returns, it also comes with higher risk. You'll need a broker account to invest in this one, and it's better suited for long-term investment goals when you can ride out market ups and downs.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Where exactly does MICF invest my money?</div>
  <div class="answer">Great question! In MICF, we invest your money in three types of secure, Shariah-compliant investments. The main ones are Islamic bank deposits, where we can negotiate better rates than individual investors might get. We also invest in Islamic money market instruments and Shariah-compliant corporate sukuks. Everything is carefully checked by our Shariah advisor to ensure it's 100% halal. Think of it as a smarter way to save while keeping your money secure and Shariah-compliant!</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">At what price should I buy MIIETF?</div>
  <div class="answer">Instead of trying to time the perfect price, I'd recommend using a strategy called Rupee Cost Averaging! This means investing a fixed amount regularly - like PKR 10,000 every month - regardless of the price. This way, you'll buy more units when prices are low and fewer when they're high, averaging out your purchase price over time. It's a smarter way to invest, especially in equity funds like MIIETF, because it reduces the stress of trying to guess the "right" time to buy.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What exactly happens to my money after I deposit it in Save+?</div>
  <div class="answer">Let me walk you through it! When you send us PKR 1,000, we don't just keep it in a box - we put it in secure Islamic banks and investments that give better returns than regular savings accounts. It's like having a friend who can get a better deal at the bank than you could get yourself. Your money starts earning profit from the very next day, and you can check your growing amount anytime on your phone.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Everyone talks about investing but I feel lost - where do I even begin?</div>
  <div class="answer">Start with Save+! It's like dipping your toes in the investment pool from the shallow end:<br>Sign up (just need your CNIC)<br>Add a small amount like PKR 1,000<br>Watch it grow daily<br>Learn at your own pace Think of it as a 'beginner-friendly mode' for investing!</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How do I invest in MIIETF?</div>
  <div class="answer">To invest in MIIETF, you'll need a broker account with any PSX broker. Once you have that, you can buy MIIETF shares through your broker's system just like regular stocks. You can find a list of top brokers at www.psx.com.pk/psx/resources-and-tools/investors/top-10-brokers.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What's the minimum investment for MIIETF?</div>
  <div class="answer">The minimum investment is 500 shares. To calculate the minimum amount needed in rupees, multiply 500 by the current share price.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Where can I find Fund Manager Reports (FMR)?</div>
  <div class="answer">Visit www.mahaana.com/micf, scroll to the bottom of the page, and click on the "Fund Manager Reports" tab.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Can I see my MIIETF portfolio on Mahaana website like I can see MICF?</div>
  <div class="answer">No, MIIETF investments can't be viewed on Mahaana's website. You'll need to track these through your broker's app or platform.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Will Zakat be deducted from my investment?</div>
  <div class="answer">Zakat is only deducted on 1st Ramadan. Don't worry - we'll send you an email and app notification a few weeks before Ramadan to sign an online Zakat exemption form if needed. Until then, you can freely invest without worrying about Zakat deductions.</div>

  <div class="question">Which is safer - MICF or MIIETF?</div>
  <div class="answer">Save+ (MICF) is definitely the safer option. It's a money market fund that invests in stable Islamic instruments, while MIIETF invests in stocks which can go up and down with the market. Choose Save+ if you want steady returns with lower risk.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I'm young and starting to invest - MICF or MIIETF?</div>
  <div class="answer">Being young, you could consider taking more exposure in MIIETF. Since you have time on your side, you can ride out market ups and downs, and historically, equity investments have given better long-term returns. However, it's smart to keep some money in Save+ (MICF) too for stability.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I need regular income - which fund should I choose?</div>
  <div class="answer">Save+ (MICF) would be better for regular income needs. It gives steady returns and you can withdraw anytime. MIIETF is more suited for long-term wealth building where you don't need the money immediately.</div>

  <div class="question">What's better for long-term investment?</div>
  <div class="answer">Historically, equity funds like MIIETF have given better long-term returns than money market funds. If you're investing for the long term and can handle market volatility, MIIETF could be a good choice. But remember, higher returns come with higher risk.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Should I invest in both MICF and MIIETF?</div>
  <div class="answer">Having a balanced approach often makes sense - some money in Save+ (MICF) for stability and regular needs, and some in MIIETF for long-term growth. The exact split depends on your age, goals, and risk tolerance.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I'm close to retirement - MICF or MIIETF?</div>
  <div class="answer">At this stage, Save+ (MICF) might be more appropriate as it offers stability and regular income. You probably want to avoid the market risks that come with MIIETF, unless you have other stable income sources.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I have PKR 100,000 - where should I invest it?</div>
  <div class="answer">If you might need this money in the next year or two, Save+ (MICF) is your safer bet. But if it's long-term savings and you can handle some market ups and downs, consider MIIETF. Many investors split their amount - maybe keep PKR 60,000 in Save+ for safety and put PKR 40,000 in MIIETF for growth potential.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I want to invest monthly - which fund is better?</div>
  <div class="answer">Both work for monthly investing! Save+ (MICF) if you're building an emergency fund or saving for near-term goals. MIIETF if you're young and saving for long-term wealth - monthly investing actually helps smooth out market ups and downs.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Which fund gives better returns?</div>
  <div class="answer">Historically, equity funds like MIIETF have given better long-term returns than money market funds like Save+. But remember - higher returns mean higher risk. MIIETF can go up and down a lot, while Save+ gives steadier, more predictable returns.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I want the safest investment option?</div>
  <div class="answer">Definitely Save+ (MICF). It's our money market fund that invests in stable Islamic instruments like bank deposits. While all investments carry some risk, Save+ is designed to be low-risk with steady returns.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I'm saving for my children's education in 10 years - which fund?</div>
  <div class="answer">With a 10-year horizon, you could consider MIIETF since you have time to ride out market volatility. Maybe start with a larger portion in MIIETF and gradually move to Save+ as you get closer to needing the money.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What if I want to start small and test both funds?</div>
  <div class="answer">Great approach! You could start with minimum amounts in both - try Save+ for steady returns and MIIETF to understand stock market investment. This gives you practical experience with both types of investing.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I want to grow my money aggressively - which fund?</div>
  <div class="answer">MIIETF would align better with aggressive growth goals. As an equity fund, it has higher growth potential over the long term, though you'll need to be comfortable with market volatility.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Which fund is better for my emergency fund?</div>
  <div class="answer">Save+ (MICF) is perfect for emergency funds. You get better returns than a regular savings account, while keeping your money easily accessible and stable.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I'm new to investing - which is easier to understand?</div>
  <div class="answer">Start with Save+ (MICF). It's simpler to understand, has lower risk, and gives steady returns. Once you're comfortable, you can explore MIIETF to learn about stock market investing.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Can I switch between funds later?</div>
  <div class="answer">Yes! While you can't directly switch (since MIIETF requires a broker account), you can always adjust your investment strategy by investing more in one fund or the other as your needs change.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What fees do you charge on Save+/MICF?</div>
  <div class="answer">All our fees are transparently shown at www.mahaana.com/micf. The returns you see already include these fees since they're built into the daily NAV calculations.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Are there hidden charges in MIIETF?</div>
  <div class="answer">No hidden charges! All fees are included in MIIETF's NAV which updates daily. Check www.mahaana.com/miietf for complete fee details. The returns you see are what you actually get - after all fees.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What's TER and how does it affect my investment?</div>
  <div class="answer">Total Expense Ratio (TER) is already built into the daily NAV calculations. For current TER figures, visit www.mahaana.com/micf for Save+ or www.mahaana.com/miietf for MIIETF. You don't need to subtract anything from your returns - they're already net of all fees.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Do I pay more expenses if I invest more money?</div>
  <div class="answer">The expense ratio stays the same regardless of how much you invest - it's a percentage. Whether you invest PKR 10,000 or PKR 1,000,000, the percentage remains the same.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Why are MIIETF's expenses shown differently than Save+?</div>
  <div class="answer">Being different types of funds, they have different cost structures. But for both funds, you can always find the current expense ratios on their respective web pages, and all returns are shown after these expenses.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I invested for one month - will I get the full annualized return?</div>
  <div class="answer">No - you'll get the actual monthly return. The annualized rate is just to help you understand the yearly perspective. If we show 12% annualized, you might get about 1% for one month (though actual returns can vary).</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Why is MIIETF performance shown differently?</div>
  <div class="answer">MIIETF's performance shows actual returns since it's affected by stock market movements, which can vary a lot. Other percentages are annualized to give you a clearer picture of long-term rates.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Do other investment companies show annualized rates too?</div>
  <div class="answer">Yes! It's an industry standard to show annualized rates. It helps you compare different investments fairly, whether you're looking at our funds or others in the market.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Is there a maximum amount I can invest or withdraw per day?</div>
  <div class="answer">Yes. Before upgrading your account, you can invest or withdraw up to PKR 400,000 per day and Pkr 800,000 in total.. After upgrading, there is no daily limit. Each limit resets at midnight.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What's the minimum I can invest?</div>
  <div class="answer">You can start with just PKR 1,000. Afterward, you can make additional deposits of at least PKR 500 at any time.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Can I set up automatic monthly investments?</div>
  <div class="answer">Currently, automatic monthly investments are not available. Each investment must be made manually as direct debit isn't supported.<br>________________</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Can overseas Pakistanis invest in Mahaana?</div>
  <div class="answer">Absolutely! Overseas Pakistanis can invest using a Roshan Digital Account (RDA). Deposits and withdrawals can be handled through RDA, and we support WhatsApp OTP for overseas phone numbers.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Is there a lock-in period for investments?</div>
  <div class="answer">There is no lock-in period. You can deposit and withdraw funds flexibly, with profits added daily. Withdrawals have no penalties.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Where can I find the Shariah compliance fatwa for Mahaana's funds?</div>
  <div class="answer">For the Shariah compliance fatwa, scroll to the bottom of the MICF or MIIETF pages and click on "Shariah Compliance."</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What does Shariah-compliant investing mean?</div>
  <div class="answer">Shariah-compliant investing avoids businesses that engage in interest, alcohol, gambling, and other prohibited activities. Investments are only in sectors and assets permissible under Islamic law.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Is there an added cost for Shariah-compliant investments?</div>
  <div class="answer">No, there’s no additional cost for Shariah compliance. The process is integrated into Mahaana’s investment structure and managed by our team.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What’s the difference between Save+ and MICF?</div>
  <div class="answer">Save+ is the portal used to invest, while MICF (Mahaana Islamic Cash Fund) is the actual fund where your money goes. Right now, Save+ is exclusively used to invest in MICF.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Can I invest in multiple funds with Save+?</div>
  <div class="answer">Currently, Save+ only supports MICF, but in the future, Save+ may offer additional funds, giving you more choices.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Is my money safe in both Save+ and MICF?</div>
  <div class="answer">Yes, Save+ is simply the platform. Your actual investment is securely held within the MICF fund, which follows strict guidelines and is overseen by Mahaana.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Will Save+ and MICF always be the same thing?</div>
  <div class="answer">While they’re effectively the same now, Save+ may support multiple funds in the future, allowing you to choose from various investment options.<br>What happens to my money if Mahaana closes down?"<br>A: If Mahaana were to close, all assets in the fund would be distributed to investors based on their share of the fund. This means you’d receive an amount according to the fund’s current Net Asset Value (NAV), minus any final expenses.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Is my investment safe if the company shuts down?</div>
  <div class="answer">Yes, because your money is invested in assets held by a trustee (Central Depository Company). Mahaana only manages the fund but doesn’t own the assets, so they’d be distributed back to you if the company closed.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Who oversees Mahaana’s funds?</div>
  <div class="answer">Mahaana’s funds are held with the Central Depository Company of Pakistan (CDC), which acts as an independent trustee. This structure safeguards your investment separately from Mahaana’s operations. The CDC’s details on fund trusteeship can be viewedhttps://www.cdcpakistan.com/businesses/trustee-custodial-services/constitutive-documents-of-funds/.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How can I verify that Mahaana’s investment funds are genuine?</div>
  <div class="answer">You can directly verify Mahaana’s credentials via the SECP's licensed entities list and CDC’s trustee documentation for added assurance.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Is my profit automatically reinvested?</div>
  <div class="answer">Yes! Your daily profits automatically become part of your investment value. When we calculate tomorrow's profit, it's based on your total value (initial investment plus all accumulated profits), so you're earning returns on your returns - that's compounding in action!</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Does skipping my monthly investment affect my returns?</div>
  <div class="answer">Not at all! Your returns are based on what's already invested. The monthly investment plan you selected is completely optional - think of it more like a goal than a rule. You'll keep earning profits on your existing investment whether you add more money or not.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Why did you ask for a monthly investment amount if it's not required?</div>
  <div class="answer">The monthly investment amount is just to help you plan your savings goals. It's not a commitment or requirement. You have complete flexibility to invest more, less, or skip months entirely - your profits continue regardless of your deposit pattern.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How do dividends work in MIIETF?</div>
  <div class="answer">Let me explain with an example. If MIIETF's price was PKR 10 at last financial year's close (June 30) and PKR 12 this financial year end, that's a PKR 2 gain per share. By law, we must distribute at least 90% of this gain as dividend. So if you own MIIETF shares, you'll get your portion of this distribution. The exact amount distributed (whether the full PKR 2 or slightly less) is decided by our fund manager.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">When are MIIETF dividends paid?</div>
  <div class="answer">While dividends are usually announced annually in early July after our financial year ends (June 30), our fund manager has the flexibility to declare dividends more frequently - quarterly or half-yearly if they choose to do so.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How is my MIIETF dividend calculated?</div>
  <div class="answer">Your dividend is based on the fund's performance over the financial year (July to June). We look at the price difference between financial year end dates, and by regulation, must distribute at least 90% of this gain. Your individual dividend depends on how many MIIETF shares you own.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Are MIIETF dividends guaranteed?</div>
  <div class="answer">Dividends depend on the fund's performance. We're required to distribute at least 90% of the gains when we make them, but if there's no price increase between financial year ends, there might not be a dividend to distribute.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Can I just withdraw my profits and leave my investment?</div>
  <div class="answer">Let me explain how withdrawals work at Mahaana. When you invest with us, your money and profits become one combined amount in units. For example, if you invested PKR 50,000 and earned PKR 10,000 in profits, your total PKR 60,000 is combined in units. When you withdraw PKR 5,000, about PKR 4,167 comes from your investment and PKR 833 from profits - you can't separate them because they're mixed together in each unit.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What happens to my investment when I make withdrawals?</div>
  <div class="answer">Every withdrawal takes a proportional amount from both your investment and profits. If you start with PKR 50,000 and earn PKR 10,000 in profits, your total PKR 60,000 is about 83% investment and 17% profit. Any withdrawal will maintain this same ratio. The good news is you only pay tax on the profit portion of your withdrawal.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">When I invest more money, do I get more units or does my unit value increase?</div>
  <div class="answer">You get more units. When you invest more money, we divide your new investment by that day's NAV to give you additional units. Your existing units keep their same value - they just continue growing as NAV increases daily.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What is Mahaana - how can I invest with them?</div>

<h2>Withdrawals & Deposits</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What is Mahaana? Is it a bank?</div>
  <div class="answer">No, we're not a bank - we're an investment company licensed by SECP (Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan). We help you invest your money in Shariah-compliant ways to earn profits. Unlike a bank, we don't just keep your money - we invest it to help it grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What if I make a mistake while depositing money?</div>
  <div class="answer">Don't worry! Our system is designed to catch mistakes. Plus, our team checks every transaction. If something looks wrong, we'll contact you right away to fix it. Your money stays safe even if you make a typing mistake.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How long does it take to process deposits and withdrawals?</div>
  <div class="answer">Deposits and withdrawals typically take 1-2 business days to process. Weekends and holidays are excluded, so if you initiate a transaction on Friday, it will likely process by Monday or Tuesday.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Can I withdraw only my profits?</div>
  <div class="answer">No, the unit-based system means withdrawals are proportional. This means both your initial investment and profits are withdrawn together; separating them is not possible.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How is tax calculated on my withdrawals?</div>
  <div class="answer">A 15% Capital Gains Tax (CGT) applies, but only to the profit portion of your withdrawal. This rate is the same for both tax filers and non-filers, and it's deducted automatically.</div>
</div>
<h2>Returns & Profits</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Do I need to calculate fees separately from my returns?</div>
  <div class="answer">Not at all! When you see your returns or NAV, these are already net of fees. We've kept it simple - what you see is what you get.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Will these expenses eat up all my profits?</div>
  <div class="answer">Not at all! The returns shown on our website are what you actually get - after all expenses. For example, if you see 10% returns, that's what you're actually getting after all costs are paid.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">I see different percentages on the website - are they all yearly rates?</div>
  <div class="answer">Yes! Except for MIIETF's performance, all percentages you see are converted to yearly rates (annualized) to make them easier to compare. It's like taking a monthly return and showing what it would look like over a full year.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">If you show 6% annualized return, what do I actually get in one month?</div>
  <div class="answer">The actual monthly return would be lower since the 6% is a yearly rate. Think of it like this - to get the monthly rate, you'd roughly divide by 12. So 6% annualized might mean about 0.5% monthly. But remember, returns can vary month to month!</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Why do you show annualized rates instead of actual monthly returns?</div>
  <div class="answer">It makes it easier to compare! When everything is converted to yearly rates, you can better understand what your money might do in the long run. It's like converting different currencies to one currency to compare prices better.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What's easier to understand - annualized or monthly rates?</div>
  <div class="answer">Annualized rates give you the big picture - like viewing a map zoomed out. While monthly rates are like looking at just your neighborhood. We show annualized to help you see the longer-term potential.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">Are my profits calculated on annualized rates?</div>
  <div class="answer">No! Your actual profits are calculated on real returns. Annualized rates are just for display and comparison. It's like how weather apps show both current temperature and predicted highs - the annualized rate is like the predicted high.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">If returns are annualized, why do they change every month?</div>
  <div class="answer">Because we recalculate the annualized rate based on the latest performance. It's like a weather forecast that updates as conditions change - we're showing what a full year might look like based on current conditions.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How are profits calculated?</div>
  <div class="answer">Profits are accrued daily and added to your total investment. They’re shown pre-tax on your portal, and any applicable management fees have already been deducted.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What proof do I have that Mahaana operates legally?</div>
  <div class="answer">Mahaana Wealth Limited operates under SECP regulations. Both SECP and CDC monitor and verify its adherence to financial and operational standards, ensuring that all investments are handled responsibly.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">What's the difference between NAV and unit - aren't they the same thing?</div>
  <div class="answer">In Save+ (MICF), NAV is the price of one unit. They're connected - NAV tells you what each unit is worth. And remember, in Save+, this value only goes up each day since it's a very low-risk money market fund.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">If NAV keeps going up, does that mean I'm making profit?</div>
  <div class="answer">Yes! When NAV increases, each unit you own is worth more. In Save+ (MICF), NAV only goes up because it's a very low-risk fund. You can track these increases daily on our website (www.mahaana.com/micf) or in your account statement.</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="question">How much profit will I make?</div>
  <div class="answer">While we can't guarantee future returns, you can check our latest performance at www.mahaana.com/micf for Save+ or www.mahaana.com/miietf for our stock market fund. Our Save+ fund gives steady returns that are typically better than regular savings accounts.</div>
