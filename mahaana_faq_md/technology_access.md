question: "How do I know how many units I have?"
answer: "Check your account statement - it shows both your total units and what each unit is worth (NAV). For example, if you invested PKR 10,000 when NAV was PKR 100, you'd have 100 units. Each day, these units will be worth slightly more as the NAV increases."

question: "When I invest more money, do I get more units or does my unit value increase?"
answer: "You get more units. When you invest more money, we divide your new investment by that day's NAV to give you additional units. Your existing units keep their same value - they just continue growing as NAV increases daily."
